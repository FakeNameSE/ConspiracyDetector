About Grant Garrett-Grossman

Who am I?
Nice to meet you! My name is Grant Garrett-Grossman (yes, I know my initials are awesome), your average bilingual (shooting for tri with English, French, and German) high school student. I am currently a rising senior high school student at the Lycée Français de Chicago.

My mission in life is to clone raptors (check out this four winged microraptor, I mean how cool is evolution, at least until mammals), become a professional pirate, and discover the answer to life the universe, and everything (or at least the question).

Aside from that, I can typically be found reading the nearest book, listening to Steely Dan and classic rock, or coding (you can check out some of those projects here).

About this site
Welcome to my website! It probably looks pretty empty to you now, but that is about to change. It hosts a combination of my portfolio and various mostly tech related blog posts, musings, and tutorials. Meanwhile, if you have to time to burn, you are welcome to poke around.
