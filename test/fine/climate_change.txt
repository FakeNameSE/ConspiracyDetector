Actuaries are becoming more aware of the combined impact of climate change and
limitations of resources—two separate and very significant issues—putting at risk the
sustainability of the current socio-economic systems that support our way of life. Although
actuaries do not claim professional expertise in environmental issues, they can be guided by
the growing body of knowledge publicly available from reliable scientific sources. Being
particularly qualified to deal with modelling financial consequences of risks and
uncertainties, the actuarial profession has a duty to provide training and education on
climate change and sustainability so that its members are qualified to contribute to the
well-being of the society as a whole. In undertaking this exercise, the actuarial
profession needs to be cognizant of the fact that even within the climate change science
community there are differing views on the nature and amplitude of the risks and the
profession should be aware of these differing views
Climate change is more than global warming. The rise in average temperature is only one
indicator of broader changes also translating into extreme temperatures, drought, flooding,
storms, rising sea levels, impacts on food production, and infectious diseases. Although the
scientific community has been aware of the link between greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
climate change for many years, world leaders have been slow to react and implement
measures to mitigate the risks.
Key sources of information on climate change are synthesised by the successive reports of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created by the United Nations and
the World Meteorological Organization in 1988. The prevalent view is that there is a
significant anthropogenic contribution to the increase in atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs
resulting from fossil fuels emissions and deforestation. Unless new policies are
implemented, global warming will exceed the threshold of 2°C agreed to by the parties to
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change for which Canada is a signatory.
In 1970, a paper by the Club of Rome pointed out that limited planet resources cannot
support unlimited exponential growth. Even renewable resources will be depleted if they
cannot be renewed fast enough. By some estimates, we are now using 50% more resources
than the sustainable level. The 8 billion population projected by 2030 is twice the 4 billion
the earth had to feed as recently as 1974. The pursuit of economic growth is compounding
the growth in demand. Global warming is exacerbating the sustainability challenge as it may

reduce agricultural production and will result in physical damage resulting from extreme
weather events, sea-level rise, etc.
Mitigating resource scarcity entails adopting new approaches such as a “circular economy”.
This refers to an industrial economy that is restorative by definition. It aims to rely on
renewable energy; favors recycling; minimizes, tracks, and hopefully eliminates the use of
toxic chemicals; and eradicates wastes through careful design. The mitigation strategy can
be guided by a new paradigm defining a planetary boundary framework providing a sciencebased
analysis of the risk that human overuse of resources will destabilize the earth system
at the planetary scale.
The potential impact on actuarial methods and assumptions, especially future growth
expectations, is pervasive in the work of actuaries and affects traditional life and non-life,
health and pensions areas, investment practices, and newer areas like enterprise risk
management. The actuarial profession has created interest groups at the national and
international levels to help deepen the understanding of the quantitative aspects of
sustainability. It can collect feedback and provide critical reviews of actuarial risk models,
establish standards of practice, and promote the adoption of best practices. The North
American actuarial associations are jointly creating actuarial climate and risk indexes that
will monitor future changes and provide comparisons of benchmarks with the data
published by climate scientists.
Actuaries can examine the different scenarios for climate change and use of resources to
quantify the risks and provide guidance through cost/benefit analyses. Given the
multidisciplinary nature of these issues, actuaries can benefit from inputs by non-actuarial
entities and work in cooperation with other professionals to serve the public interest
through optimizing policy options.
