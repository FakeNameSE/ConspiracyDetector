Obama, has supported abortion on demand and thwarted religious freedom via his many domestic policies – Obama Care, and Gay “Marriage” to name only two. He continues to associate with members of the Muslim Brotherhood, he has revealed his antipathy towards Israel, and continues to preach tolerance for Islam while chastising Christians.

Let me put it this way: not only is Obama the most powerful jihadist in the World – he is in my estimation anti-Christ – if not the Anti-Christ foretold in the book of Revelation.

Revelation chapter thirteen makes it very clear that the anti-Christ would be a worker of wonders and seducer of the world. And that he would systematically seek to destroy the Seed of Christ on the earth.

The Anti-Christ of the book of Revelation is an individual who wields world-wide power and world-wide influence. His hatred for Christ and the people of Christ is legendary and very real.

To any observant individual Obama embodies all the characteristics of the legendary nemesis.

Obama’s reaction to the suffering of people such as Pastor Sayeed in Iran is, if nothing else, a manifestation of anti-Christian bigotry. And frankly, I wouldn’t surprise me if he goes down as history’s Anti-Christ of Revelation.
