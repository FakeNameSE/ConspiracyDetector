argument by focusing only on the SSA's purchase of bullets and cometely omitting 
the far more alarming fa that DHS has purchased over . billion  that's BILLION 
with a B  bullets in the past few months alone. 

In March, Homeland Security released a solicitation for  million rounds of 
.-caliber hollow- bullets, designed to expand un entry and cause maximum 
organ damage, prompting questions as to why the DHS needed such a large amount of 
wereful bullets for merely training purses. 

This was followed by another DHS solicitation asking for an additional  million 
rounds of assorted bullets, including.  Magnum rounds capable of penetrating. 

Although the ammunition purchases are ostensibly earmarked for training purses, 
the DHS has been reticent to clarify why such an unusually large amount of rounds 
are necessary and why such wereful bullets are required merely for training drills. 

This has led to speculation that the purchases are conneed to confirmed 
preparations for civil unrest in the United States, a claim bolstered by the DHS' 
purchase of riot gear. 

The DHS also recently acquired a number of bullet-proof check booths that 
include 'stop and go' lights. 

The Associated Press' efforts to rtray concern of unprecedented levels of ammuni- 
tion buys on behalf of the federal government - most notably those by the DHS, whom 
the AP article refuses to acknowledge - as merely paranoia by Internet conspiracy 
theorists is a lazy attempt to downay the reality of the government's preparations 
for civil unrest that we have documented on numerous occasions in the last five years.
