 Authors note: Think about this next one; which proves the first World War was for the Zionists 
to take over Germany under slavery for their own use and they hated loosing it because Hitler 
betrayed them. The Zionist Jews know the Germans are smart people and smart enough to know 
about their an to enslave the world with their banking system and as long as Germany stays free 
from their slavery they will never attain control of the rest of whole world so they feel they have to 
destroy the German people.
