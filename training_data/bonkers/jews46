bench said it was). Then in  Justice Benjamin Cardozo said I take judge-made law as one of the existing 
realities of life. With this kind of decisions coming from our courts, we have lost our great U.S. Constitution that 
the founding fathers fought and died to give us, along with the rights of the juries which come from the Magna- 
Carta signed in . Today this legacy is reaced with the situation ethics of Secular Humanism. The U.S. 
Constitution says the Legislature is to make all laws; Judges have no law-making were except, what they 
have usurped. We are being conquered, not by foreign troops, but by these treasonous domestic enemies within 
our nation, that are ruining our courts and nation, undermining the freedoms and liberty we have taken for granted. 
They demand that we trade God Given unalienable rights for government privileges! The Bible calls these lawyers 
Scribes, Pharisees and Hycrites. I call them SHYSTERS. *(The word "Hycrite" means "imster, see 
Strong's Bible Concordance, Greek Word #.) 

We are born with our rights - they cannot legally be taken away. We can, of course, give them up 
and become serfs or slaves, but our rights cannot be taken atjjjp llt the government without force. 

We could give them up or sell rights or our birthright for a bowl of bean soup (red ttage), just 
as Esau did to his brother Jacob in the Bible. We are selling our birthrights by accepting gifts, from the 
government, such as incorration for a tax exemption, when a true Church has always had the 
right to exist and not to be taxed or in ain words IMMUNITY FROM TAXES and 
Government. The government cannot legally take our Rights, but it has already tricked many o 
accepting privileges, granted by government, in exchange for our God given Rights which our 
Constitution and the I.R.S. recognizes. 

Isn`t it a fa the lawyers and government have done this, to the Churches so subtly, with 
craftiness and cunningness, the American people have not even been aware of it? Is the governments

silence while taking the God given rights from the Churches, exceedingly deceitful and devious to the 
 of criminal conspiracy and fraud? After finding out about this criminal fraud, many Churches are 
beginning to un-incorrate. After finding that they can regain there rights very easily. The Supreme 
Court ruled that  Fraud vitiates ( cancels ) the most solemn promise to pay . Where there is fraud, no 
contra exists.  In other words, that much of our government, because it is run by lawyers, has entered 
o a gigantic scheme with the lawyers to defraud the American people of there free Churches, freedom 
to worship and stand for their rights, their birth right. Because this has been done fraudulently, We the 
people do not have to go along with the scam any longer. We as citizens must and will demand our 
GOD given Rights. The difference in simy believing in the God given truths and laws in the Holy 
Bible as most people do, and for ministers being able to freely teach them to our congregations is 
paramount, to losing the greatest right our God in heaven ever gave us. FREEDOM! ! 

TEACHING many things from the Bible is considered by the Government a Political stand 
which Corrations are bared from doing. 

Incorration of Churches is a subje that I could write a whole book on, but instead, will give 
the name of an author who has already done a great job. The name of the book is EVIL IN THE LAND 
THE CHURCH AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER, by BUZZ SATTER WHITE, Publius Press c/o

It`s out of control! 

Judges Destroying Families and Lives: 

The "Child Abuse Industry, run by the courts 

The Bible says, in Proverbs :, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth 
him chasteneth him betimes, " in other words, "Spare the rod and sil, the child. " It is against the 
law to raise children to be criminals, yet we let the UNCHRISTIAN judicial system tell us we cannot 
even spank a child for breaking a law. The children soon learn this and use it against the parents. The 
Christians have lost control of the country to the Godless judges and courts (another humanist religion), 
which has reaced Christianity, which makes it easier for the bankers to control a demoralized country. 
Now we have a Zionist government-snsored humanist religion, forced on us, which is being taught in 
schools, and they are also forcing their counterfeit, anti-Christian laws, morals and dogma on us. I will 
give one of a thousand different scenarios that could be used. 

Exame: Some one that wishes to remain anonymous tips a social worker or lice officer off, 
that a father or mother has spanked a wayward child. Immediately, the child is taken, by order of a 
judge, by lice who show up armed with guns. Without a trial, the child is taken from the home, and 
put in a secret foster home. The parents or relatives have no way of finding the child forever. Several 
times recently here in Florida they have taken and put young white girls and boys in unchristian, black 
foster homes where they have been raped, sodomized, and sexually molested for long periods of time. 
Then, months or even years later, when it came to the attention of the public, after the girls or boys life 
had been scarred or ruined, what can ever be done to undo the harm the tyrannical judge, drunken with 
his own were has done? Remember many liberal States won`t even consider a Christian home for a 
foster home to begin with. 

Note: The race issue is not a good guy/bad guy issue. God told us ten times (the number that 
means perfe) in the first chapter of the Bible kind after kind. It is racially and genetically healthy and 
pure to be separate. Every race is race conscious of his own race and this is good. God`s laws prote 
the home-born as well as the stranger in our midst. His laws prote all, regardless of race. To prove it is 
not a racial issue, the Negro race is still comaining about (and rightly so), how their ancestors were 
kidnapped and sexually abused back when they were slaves. No one ever forgets. This is why no judge

should ever put any child in a situation like this. Yes, things like this happen all over America thousands 
of times every day. 

Instead of doing the Christian or Godly thing like, if a parent has really mistreated a child, there 
are enty of laws on the books against assault and battery, which can be used to get that parent out of the 
home and punished. Why punish the child by taking the child out of the home just when the child needs 
the other parent more than ever, if the child has been abused? If both parents are guilty there are the 
grandparents, aunts, uncles and other family members that would be glad to help? Then there are also 
the neighbors, Church members and any number of others of the same race that can and would help. 
Why then, this damnable punishment of the child, when it needs to be with relatives or friends, by putting 
them in a secret foster home with strangers? When our Country was not under the present tyrannical 
law, a child belonged to the family and not to the Zionist controlled State! It is a licy of the 
Zionist Controlled United Nations, under the New World Order Bankers, to take control of our children 
and to eventually license parents too, just as they do in China. Not only license but limit the number of 
children a coue can have by forced abortions. 

The social workers are told in their training, if there is any suspicion of an infraion of a statute 
or regulation, just simy to go ahead and take the child out of its home. They are told that with the 
multitude of laws on the books today, they can find violations in every home in America, to charge the 
parents with, so don`t to be afraid to take any child, weather they have any proof of a violation or not, 
because they can always find legal justification later. 

Now; Think of the hundreds of millions of dollars, these falsely accused parents, have to pay in 
lawyers fees ever year, just to try to get their children back, even if they were falsely charged.. 
Remember it was lawyers in the legislature, who passed these damnable laws, to enrich there own kind, 
justice for the children and families be dammed. Remember it is against the  th Amendment of the 
constitution for a Lawyer to be in the Judicial, legislative, or executive branch of government. The HRS 
or social services, a part of the lice growth industry, is the fastest growing business in the USA today. 
The judges and lawyers have found destroying families lucrative, because most loving, God fearing 
families, will spend their last dollar to defend their children and families from being broken up. I ask 
how much lowere can these BASTARDS get? 

Last year in the U.S. they falsely accused, more than one million families of child abuse. Some 
went through the humiliation, of an investigation for child abuse and were cleared. Although their 
names remain in government files as suspeed child abusers, for a period ranging from five years to 
forever, these are the lucky ones. They also loose certain Constitutional rights, like the right to have guns 
in their homes. For hundreds of documented cases, of outrageous fas about child and parent abuse, by 
the State courts that threaten every North American family, read the book,  The Child Abuse Industry 
by Mary Pride. 

Others, not so fortunate, found themselves in compulsory counseling programs. Still, others lost 
their houses and bank accounts fighting these unjust charges. Many lost their jobs and sitions in the 
community. The State keeps all children they take, from one to six months, before the parents are 
allowed to even see them again, whether they are guilty or not. Others, the saddest of all, without 
money to hire GOOD lawyers lost their children. The social workers have a quota of children to take, 
in order to keep their funding coming from the government, so child roundup time never stops! 

Then the States run by the judges even advertises on T.V., to find women that have had 
arguments with their husbands; then, inviting the wives to be quitters, by offering them free housing, 
money, help and encouragement, anything to separate and break up a family. Before, they had all this 
free help and they made leaving so easy, the women would do the Christian or Godly thing, return home 
and reconcile their differences, make up, and have a better, stronger maage than ever before. 

All maages have their rough times, and usually both parties are to blame. Never the less, the 
liberal judges always blame the man. Then, do not forget the court-snsored divorce mills, designed to
