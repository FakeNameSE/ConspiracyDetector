tentially terminable diseases. The American people 
and the ill no longer count; only the budget counts. 
Letting the elderly die sooner is cheaper. We can 
therefore afford more wars for hegemony and more tax 
cuts for the one percent. 

Have any peoples in human history ever been less 
represented by their government and litical parties 
than Americans? 

The U.S. government represents Israel and the one to 
ten percent. Everyone else is dissable. 

Regardless of which litical party's lever is pulled in 
November, every American who votes will be voting for 
Israel and for their own demise.

The Associated Press whitewashes the controversy over feds buying ammunition

quantities of ammunition, focusing on the Social Security Administration's 
purchase of , bullets while cometely ignoring a far larger purchase by 
the DHS that totaled more than . billion bullets. 

In a story titled Social Security buys , hollow- bullets; Internet bursts 
with conspiracy theories, which was caed by dozens of major newspapers, the 
AP quotes an August Infowars.com story that rerted which rerted on the SSA's 
purchase of , rounds of hollow  bullets scheduled to be delivered to  
tions across the country. 

's not outlandish to suggest that the Social Security Administration is purchasing

a Department of Homeland Security drill earlier this year called Operation Shield, 
which included turning the entrance of a Florida Social Security office o a check-

The AP whitewash fails to mention the DHS exercise, which was geared towards 
proteing the Social Security office in the event of civil unrest.

salacious tidbit gets amified and embellished on the Internet," making reference to
