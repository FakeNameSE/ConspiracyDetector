in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron 
un thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. 

 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth as swift 
as the eagle flieth: a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; 

Read the above verse without the two added italicized underlined words  as swift  and you 
will see that the enemy flies as an eagle. What else but an airane can our enemy fly in? For those who 
say this chapter is for a time in the past; the author would ask; could any nation fly in the past ages? 

 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor slew 
favor to the young: 


Russia or China, more on this later? 

 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: 
which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy 
sheep, until he have destroyed thee. 

When they invade which they have already started, they shall rob and under our farmers, stores 
and homes as they travel. About  years ago the author saw a  Minute TV program, where they were 
telling how over , Chinese had immigrated o the city of Vancouver Canada, in the last few 
years. The Canadian law lets anyone with $,. Dollars come in to Canada. The Chinese came to 
Canada, then would send the same money back to China for their relatives or friends to immigrate with, 
and so on and on it goes, re-using the same money over and over. 

Just recently the news was full of how many Chinese were illegally, coming o the U.S. in 
container freight, some dying on route. 

 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls comedown, 
wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates 
throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, 
which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine 
enemies shall distress thee: 

 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward 
his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he 
shall leave: 

 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: 
because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall 
distress thee in all thy gates. 

 The tender and the delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the 
sole of her foot un the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the 
husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 

 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her 
children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and 
straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. 

 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this 
book. (Deuteronomy) that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 

 Then the LORD will make thy agues wonderful, and the agues of thy seed, even great 
agues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. 

 More over he will bring un thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; 
and they shall cleave unto thee. 

 Also every sickness, and every ague, which is not written in the book of this law, 
them will the LORD bring un thee, until thou be destroyed. 

 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for 
multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God. 

 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to 
multiy you; so the LORD will reioice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought , 
and ye shall be ucked from off the land whither thou goest to ssess it. 

 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth 
even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy 
fathers have known, even wood and stone. 

 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have 
rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 

AN EXAMPLE; Just look at the white people who live in South Africa, where at least  % of 
the white women are raped at least once every year, by black men, and nothing is done about it. Whites 
are out numbered twenty to one in South Africa. 

FACT: When White man moved to South Africa, there were no Negroes living in all of South 
Africa, because it was too cold for them. They did not have clothes warm enough. Then the whites 
thought they needed cheap help, so they started bringing the natives from the north down to South Africa 
as laborers. Soon more and more blacks heard of the prosperity of their kinfolks who had gone south and 
went south also. Now look at the situation there with whites out numbered  to . Is another of God`s 
curses coming true? 

In South Africa as well as Australia today they (the Zionist Jewish officials and their 
Christian dupes, who defend them), have outlawed all guns and ammunition, and called for their 
comete destruion. Now only an outlaw will have the means to defend him self and his wife, sons 
and daughters from robbers, murders, and rapists. 

Why is it that for European- Americans (white people), the subje of race, is forbidden in social 
circles unless it is to elevate African Americans, regardless of the fas. Black crime or Zionist Jewish 
Banking cannot be discussed, for exame, without ing to white oppression as the real culprit. 
White Americans may only speak of their race in negative terms, falsely admitting that they are the cause 
of all other people`s problems. We are made to feel guilty about our God given heritage.

THE FIRST VICTIM IN THIS GUILT- MANIPULATION SCENARIO IS  TRUTH  

To reje truth is to reje God. The Bible clearly warns: The heart is deceitful above all 
things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? (Jeremiah :). 

When it comes to sensitive issues such as race, many people will say, I know that's what the 
Bible appears to say, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Are they judging God? Solomon's wisdom 
speaks to this very issue, as we read: 

"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death" 
(Proverbs : ). 

FACT: THINK ABOUT THIS!! You can go o any Library or book store in the country, and 
get a book on any race on earth, like; African Roots, the Chinese, American Indians, Australian 
Aborigines and all other people, But I defy you to find a book on the white mans origins. The reason 
for this is the Zionists in government, when they send out money to libraries, Colleges, and schools for 
new books they demand they get rid, of all books on a list, having to do with the origins of white men. 
They are gone!! They don`t want us to know white mans roots! Is this racial bigotry, or is it? Whites 
have a great heritage if they just knew it. 

Most all of us are subjeed to a never-ending stream of emotional manipulation, through the 
various forms of mass media, which is totally Zionist Jewish controlled, News Papers, TV, Radio, and 
Hollywood. They will use this media to capture your heart. Even our public education system, has 
become more of a humanist indorination system. The modern world is taught to feels rather than to 
think. 

We are not racists! This word is an epithet, which is often carelessly abused and frequently used, 
by those who lack fas and a good argument. While elleually dishonest, it bypasses reason and 
often gains converts (of a kind). The concept of racism, and even the word itself, is relatively new to 
history. The word does not appear in Noah Webster's original  diionary, of the English language. 
The words racist and racism have caused more confusion, than enlightenment, and modern 
diionary definitions of these terms, have widely varying imications. However, modern usage 
predominately defines racist, as one who hates other races and believes them to be inferior to his own. 
By this pular definition, we cannot ssibly be racist! The Bible teaches that God created all the races. 
He said: AND GOD SAW EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD MADE, AND BEHOLD. TT WAS VERY 
GOOD. AND THE EVENING AND THE MORNING WERE THE SIXTH DAY.  (GENESIS  :). 

We must contend then, therefore that race hatred constitutes a sin against God and his 
creation.
