afflied, and they shall kill some of you, and ye shall be hated for my name's sake." This could not refer 
to the Jews, for they have never been hated for the sake of Christ. They blaspheme Him in their 
synagogues, and in their religious writings. They have been among the worst persecutors of Christians in 
the history of the Church. The International Zionist-Communist leaders have been resnsible for the 
deaths of over -million people in the past  years, including millions of Christians. We keep hearing 
about "holocaust in Germany," where six-million Jews were supsed to have perished (This has been 
proven to be one of the greatest hoaxes in world history), but when have you seen our media, or our 
TV, or movies make a documentary film telling the truth about Christian deaths at the hands of Jewish 
Communists? Why hasn't someone built a museum to commemorate Christian deaths at the hands of the 
Zionist-Communists? You can't answere that, can you? .... 

In Matthew , or Luke  does Jesus say: "Don't worry about these days; I'll come back and get 
you out before they get too bad!" Instead, He warns in Luke : - "And ye shall be betrayed, both by 
parents, and brethren, and kinfolks, and friends; and some of you shall be put to death." 

In Matthew , Jesus tells the story of the WHEAT AND TARES, and then goes on to exain its 
meaning in verse . "The tares are the wicked persons, " He exains, "they will be gathered out of this 
world at the end of this age." To all appearances, the wheat will remain to set up our Lord's kingdom on 
this earth. 

Later in this same chapter, verses -, He gives the illustration of the GOOD AND BAD FISH. 
Notice verse  - "And ad the good o vessels, but cast the bad away; so shall it the end of the world" 
(age); NOTICE VERY CAREFULLY "The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from I the 
righteous." Haven't you been taught the other way around? Jesus taught, quite clearly, that the wicked 
would be taken out of the world and the good would remain to set up His kingdom.

Now I know that some of you who read this message are going to be very upset with what I have 
said. There is no doubt in my mind, that some of you won't be honest enough to read any farther. I can 
tell you I was mighty upset, when this truth first dawned on me. The rapture is something everyone 
would like to believe in. It gives you a sense of false security. It's nice to feel that you don't have to be 
concerned with the corruption all about you. In fa this teaching has made a lot of Christians "so 
heavenly minded, that they are no earthly good" 

If I was an unsaved man or woman, I'd like to believe the theory that since God is a God of love, 
He's going to fix it so that everyone is saved in the end! That's a lovely theory, but it's ison out of the 
pits of hell! It's the same kind of warped thinking that makes you say: "Sure, we know the Jews are a bad 
bunch now, but one day God is going to save all of them." That promise wasn't even made to the Jews, it 
was made to the, Israelites and they are a cometely different crowd. ... 

When I first began my study, I went to my pastor, whom I considered a very close friend. I took 
him some material, very carefully documented and asked him to look at it. I said: "I don't expe you to 
accept this, but I think you should know about it." I glanced at it and when he saw it was critical of the 
Zionists, threw it away and pronounced me an astate. He said: "You know, if you persist in this 
foolishness, the doors of every Baptist church in America will be closed to you." 

I had suspeed for some time, that there were some Baptist who believe that if you don't agree 
with them you are headed for hell, but this is as close as I've every come to having it put in words. But 
one thing I learned a long time ago, the majority is usually wrong. That's why Moses told the Israelites: 
"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil." 

Well I felt so strongly about my newfound knowledge, I wanted to share it with my Christian 
friends, for their safety depended on what they did about it. That was when I wrote my  letter, which 
was sent out to  fundamental preachers and laymen.  never liked to sail under a false flag, and I 
wanted them to know what I had learned, before they invited me o their churches. As I said, the result 
was an almost % cancellation of all my scheduled meetings for . 

Why? I preach the same messages, with the same fervor. I'm stronger in the fundamentals of the 
faith than at any time in my life. I'll put my preaching up for comparison with any of the fundamental 
greats like Bob Jones, Jr., Jack Hyles, or Jack Van Impe. I don't have to be ashamed of what I'm 
preaching, for I preach straight out of the Word of God and I'm not one bit afraid of what other preachers 
say about me. 

But there is a difference. Now I'm getting to the heart of the moral and spiritual problems which 
are strangling us. I'm going behind the scene of the problems the Moral Majority claims to be fighting. 
The only problem is, they want to cut off the arms of the monster, when what we need to do is get to its 
heart. 


You can go back as far as you want to during the , ye written history and find that mankind 
has always hoped for a "Golden Age," of peace and prosperity. Many religions predi this for their 
followeres. The schemers have aimed at domination, whether... it was dream of International 
Communism, or the world, Jewish controlled empire of Zionism. The United Nations was a dream of a 
great, one-world government, with a one world church, Where all men would live in peace and 
brotherhood where verty and disease would be conquered for all time let me tell you my friends, it is 
not going to come during a years reign of Zionist Jewish supremacy, such as the fundament visualize. 

Zionism is a man-made scheme which is doomed for failure because they have left God out of 
their calculations. I am not trying to tell you that the Christians who hold this theory are Un Christian, but 
they have allowed themselves to be fooled by Jewish propaganda, which has cost this world countless 
billions of dollars and much suffering. 

The non-Christian ideas of world-Jewish supremacy are to fail, because they are founded on the 
false premise of inherent goodness of mankind. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a known Jew has said: "We do

not believe in heaven as the Christian do; we do not believe that the salvation of man will come through a 
Christ on a cross. We believe it will through the unfolding of technology and the inherent goodness of 
mankind. These ultimately, will bring about heaven on earth. This my friend is Jewish teaching and is 
contrary to everything our Lord stands for. 

Some teachings will fail because they are nowhere promised in the Scriptures. Christ was 
cometely silent about any reign Jewish were, centered in Jerusalem. Neither, the Gospel the Book of 
As, nor the Epistles, speak of a Jewish dominated world were, inhabited by mortals and immortals, at 
the end of this age. 

The epistles give no h of a Jewish return to Palestine, and the setting up of a mighty world 
kingdom, with its capitol city in Jerusalem. Many of the Epistles were written to countera these 
Judaizing influences in the early church. 

A careful study of the Epistles, will show you how very foolish it is to use the term Judeo- 
Christian, which we hear sken so glibly from our fundamental pulpits. Nothing could be farther truth. 
Judaism and Christianity are at the opsite ends of the Religious le. The Mohammedans are closer to 
Christianity religious belief, than the Jews, for they believe Jesus as a great prophet, while the Jews call 
Him a bastard and spit on His name. (If you don't want to believe this, I challenge o a bit of studying o 
Jewish beliefs.) 

It is true that the early discies had been "brainwashed" by teachings concerning an earthly 
kingdom and they even fought each other to see who would be chief in that kingdom. But they never 
received any encouragement from their master and by Pentecost, they had been delivered from this false 
belief. 

It was this Judaizing influence which caused the Astle Paul to warn Titus in (:) not to "give 
heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of man, that turn from the truth." 

If Christ had offered the Jews of His day a literal litical kingdom with all the mp of 
Solomon, they would have flocked to His standard. But when He told them: "My kingdom is not of this 
world they turned away from Him. It was then that He told their leaders, "Ye can not know me, because 
ye are not of my Sheep So the Jews not only turned their backs on Christ, they killed Him. 

To believe that the restoration of a heathen, basically atheistic group like the Jews will take ace 
in Old Palestine, under God's banner, would be a reversal of the natural order of events carry us 
backwards instead of forwards. It would from Jesus Christ, back to Cain, the murderer of his brother. It 
would take us from the Church and true Israel, to the counterfeit Israel we call the Jews. It would be a 
hoble, anticlimaic thing, Christian-Israel, superseded by heathen, Talmudic Judaism. You can rest 
assured that God will not let this happen. ... 

During the past sixty years, the Rapture teaching has be spread far and wide, by the use of the Schofield 
Reference Bible which also teaches that the Jews are God's Chosen Peoe. Unfortunately, many 
fundamentalists seem to believe the foot notes, written by Dr. Schofield, have the same authority of Holy 
Writ. They do not! To such a naive individual, the Schofield Reference Bible can be a danger. ... 

In Psalm :, we read, "...our enemies laugh among themselves ." How they must, as they see 
Christians neutralized by preaching coming from their own pulpits. How they must laugh, as they see the 
worst enemies of Christ, dignified with the title of God's Chosen Peoe. How they must laugh, as they 
see Christian soldiers seduced from being "front line waors" for Jesus Christ, to become sniveling, 
spiritual cowards who huddle In their spiritual foxholes, while the battle for Christian civilization rages 
all about them.... 

Unfortunately, many people who go by the name of Christian, have become traitors, not only to 
the cause of Christ, but to their country. I say this, because they are engaged in "giving aid and comfort 
to the enemy." If you belong to a church that contributes to the National Council of Churches, you have
