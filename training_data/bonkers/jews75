JEWS 

NEITHER JEWS NOR ANY OTHER PEOPLE CAN BE GRAFTED ON TO ISRAEL, 
ONLY WILD OFFSHOOTS OF THE ISRAEL PEOPLE ALONE 
The word "Jew" wasn't even used in the Bible until about , years after Abraham, 
Moses, Isaac, Jacob / Israel were dead and buried. The word Jews first used in nd Kings th 
chapter, (and then was a mistranslation. It should have been translated "yehuwdiy") where Israel drove 
the Jews from their midst because of their wickedness, contrary to what is taught in the modern so called 
Judaeo Christian Churches, that these men were Jews. It just ain't so! ! ! What does the Bible say? 

Jews properly translated from the Hebrew word (yehuwdiy) 

Matt. : Pharisees sit in Moses's seat 

Matt. : Then said all the Jews, Let His blood be on us and our children 
John :- Ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do 

II Kings : First time the word Jews used in the Bible
