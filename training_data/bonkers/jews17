opsite or anti-thesis of money), where inflation is automatic, and people are penalized for thrifty 
saving, instead of borrowing from bankers. It used to be not only shameful to borrow and pay erest, 
but sinful and unchristian according to God's ways in the Bible, which has been reaced by the so called, 
American way. Now the bankers advertise on T.V. and tell us the lies, of how necessary it is for us to 
build good credit, even if we don't need it, to borrow anyway, just to improve our credit rating etc. 

The tragic result of the money-switch was the change in the form of government at all levels. In 
stead of a resnsible Republic, with checks and balances and constitutional limitations, on 
government jurisdiion and were, America was put back o the ancient tyrannical mold of 
democracy; rule by a bare majority with no standards or limits. In ain words  mob rule , no 
different from a  lynch mob  that is incited to a  of rage, then as or passes a law, to take or 
rob another freedom from us. Now days our eleed representatives come home from a session of 
legislation, bragging about how many laws they passed. 

But they don`t stop to think that after a new law is passed, EITHER WE MUST DO 
SOMETHING WE NEVER HAD TO DO BEFORE; OR WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING, WE 
ALWAYS HAD FREEDOM TO DO BEFORE. THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS WHAT EACH LAW 
ROBS FROM US. BEFORE A NEW LAW IS PASSED, WE HAD FREEDOM TO MAKE OUR OWN 
CHOICE; as long as we didn't deprive someone else of their life, liberty or property. We 
now have lost our right, to choose for ourselves. We are now forced by law. Every time a law is passed, 
we loose a freedom. While loudly esusing equality, and anti discrimination, our banker controlled 
democracy, rules can now legally discriminate against them a minority, by giving their jobs, heritage 
or birthright and what is left of their homes and life savings away to foreigners. The Psalmist could aptly 
ask again (Psalm :) "If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

CHAPTER  

CONTINUING WITH THIS FRAUD MOST PEOPLE DON`T KNOW  WE HAVE 
TWO FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S.A HERE IS WHERE WE LOST 
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, AND AMERICA BECAME A;  SOCIALIST 
DEMOCRACY  AND IT WAS DONE BY SLICK SCHEMING ZIONIST LAWYERS IN 
SECRET, WHILE AMERICA SLEPT THESE ZIONISTS BANKERS HAD THEIR SHYSTER 
LAWYERS CREATED A SECOND GOVERNMENT TO RULE AMERICA WITH. IT WAS 
DONE WITHOUT THE POPULATION BEING MADE AWARE OF THE CHANGE. 

This second unconstitutional government in the U.S.A. was created to further rob the trusting American 
people of their freedom, and put us further o slavery. And this is just one of the thousands of things they have 
done to deprive us of our constitutional rights our property and our money. 

The first and original government is the Continental united States for which the Constitution for the united 
States was written. As you can see by looking at a copy of our constitution the AC in united States of America is 
always a little AC. This government is always bound by the Constitution. Government or country number 
one, the original united States of America, is a republic. 

#. Government number two, created later, is a corration or a ˜democracy, and was created originally for 
congress to govern the capitol city Washington or the Distri of Columbia (DISTRICT OF CROMINALS). Since 
then it has been expanded to the  where the States have UNKNOWINGLY volunteered o its jurisdiion, 
there by at the same time, loosing the proteion of our original constitution. This trick, stratagem or should I say 
deliberate theft snsored by scheming conniving Zionist Jew lawyers is what was used to perpetrate this fraud 
and to destroy our republican form of government. The same thing they did to most Churches. 

The second government that was created later is nothing but a corration and called "The United States 
of America" (spelled with a capital "U"). Now remember, a corration is a "fiion", by law a fiitious paper 
person without rights, (a "democracy"). This country, spelled with a capital "U" UNITED STATES is not bound 
by the U.S. Constitution nor do its citizens have Constitutional rights. This country is free to borrow debt money 
and to sign up its citizens o voluntary slavery under the voluntary Social Security system and the Internal 
Revenue Service. You have to volunteer o the Social Security which will put you under the IRS. REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU SIGNED UP BY GETTING A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD NUMBER, OR OPENING A BANK 
ACCOUNT AND SIGNING THE BOTTOM OF A SIGNATURE CARD, THAT REQUIRES YOU TO KEEP 
ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK, YOU VOLUNTEERED 
YOURSELF INTO CONTRACT WITH THIS SYSTEM OF SLAVERY, AND YOU ARE NO LONGER A 
FREE MAN. Now you have to perform exaly as your contra (I.R.S. code) specifies, and any court in the land 
will uphold this contra the same as they will any other contra you are fool enough to sign. 

The only way to get out of this contra is to revoke your signature on the contras you have with them on 
the grounds that they were fraudulendy represented to you, (usually while you were a minor). The Supreme Court 
has ruled that "fraud" vitiates the most solemn promise to pay or obey. So there is a way out. 

The I.R.S. states in their I.R. Code. , that the only persons who are truly taxable are "corrate 
officers, emoyees or eleed officials of the United States, the Distri of Columbia, or any agency or 
instrumentality of the United States, (which belongs to the Corrate United States), a state or litical subdivision 
thereof; or any one of the foregoing." 

Now as you can see from the above, if you don't work for the government, the I.R.S. doesn't have the 
were to tax you unless you volunteer o their system as most people do. 

Next you may ask doesn't the word "state" above cover everyone in the fifty states? The answere is no, 
because when we look up the word "state" in the I.R. code (I.R.C.  E) it says the term "state" above includes 
the Distri of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. It has nothing to say 
about the  States. 

As you can see from the I.R.S. description of the word "state," which means one of the fifty states to you, 
in reality it means, only the ten mile square Distri of Columbia, and the ssessions that come under the 
jurisdiion of the Federal Corrate United States of America such as their ssessions, forts, naval yards. 
Federal buildings, etc. There is not one word about the fifty states covered by the Continental united States of 
America's Constitution. (Words have a different meaning by law than the everyday usage).

To answere "yes" on any government form that asks: "Are you a citizen of the United States?" is a 
lie, but it volunteers you o the tax system, even if they had to use trickery to get you to sign. To be a 
United States citizen, you have to live in Washington, D.C. or one of its ssessions. You should be a 
Citizen of the state you live in, (your state) not the United States. 

The critical  in the fateful usury / inflation cycle slipped by us in the dark confusion of the 
great depression, when about , F.D. Roosevelt called in the gold, took America off our sound 
economic standard of "substance" (gold and silver), and put us on a paper debt money system (borrowed 
by our treasury from the private bank called "Federal Reserve," which is neither Federal nor a Reserve 
but a private credit system or bank given the were to issue debt notes in ace of real money, as you can 
prove to yourself by just looking at the top of any Federal Reserve note.) (A note is a debt, a promise to 
pay, the opsite or antithesis of money) where inflation is automatic and people are penalized for 
thrifty saving instead of borrowing from bankers. It used to be not only shameful to borrow and 
pay erest, but sinful and un Christian according to God's ways in the Bible, which has been 
reaced by the so called "Capitalist way." Now the bankers advertise on T.V. and tell us the lies of how 
necessary it is for us to build good credit, even if we don't need it, to borrow anyway, just to improve our 
credit rating etc. But it just puts more money in to the ckets of the Zionists. 

Note; The F.R.B., unlike any other private corration, has such influence that it has not 
ever been cometely audited by the Government. Ron Paul had a partial audit done. 

The tragic result of the money switch was the change in the form of government at all levels. 
Instead of a resnsible republic with checks and balances and constitutional limitations on government 
jurisdiion and were, America was put back o the ancient tyrannical mold of "democracy", rule by a 
bare majority with no standards or limits. In ain words "mob rule," is no different from a lynch mob 
that is incited to a  of rage, then as or passes a law to take or rob another freedom from us. Our 
right to choose for ourselves is being taken from us. We are now forced by "colorable law", either we 
must do something we never had to do before, or we can't do something in which we had freedom do 
before, so long as we didn't deprive someone else of his life, liberty or property. While loudly esusing 
"equality" and "anti-discrimination", our Zionist banker controlled "democracy" rules can now legally 
discriminate against the majority by giving their jobs, heritage or birthright and what is left of their 
homes and life-savings away to foreigners. The Psalmist could aptly ask again (Psalm :) "If the 
foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" *All colorable "law" is unconstitutional. 

Look how many local eleions or spending referendums are won by a small majority, when only 
% or % of the registered voters even turned out to vote. Then we must remember about half of the 
people don`t even bother to register to begin with. But it`s this small "Democratic" minority that are 
voting away our rights, and putting us o debt slavery! 

Our laws are no longer formulated for the good of "we the people" (or any other people), but 
solely for the good of the ernational Zionist controlled New World Order bankers who control most 
other nations exaly the same way, by Babylonian "credit were." The courts, as indicated by the 
yellow fringe flags in the courtrooms, no longer deal in "public law," but "public licy," to help 
the Zionist ernational bankers' foreclosure on all the people, property and farms in the former 
"land of the free". The "laws" are now New World Order Commercial "law", not U.S. 
Constitutional Law. The UNO, the NWO and the Zionist bankers have bought our soul. Perhaps Isaiah 
foresaw that only God could get us out of this mess, if we repent and obey (Is.:-; and Is.:l; and 
-). 

The chickens are now coming home to roost, from the Bankers, lawyers and scribes well kept 
secret, that the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WENT BANKRUPT IN THE 'S, by 
subsidizing the nation within a nation, Washington D.C.; (U.S. Constitution Art. , Se. , (Ch. ). 
The weres that be, the Zionist bankers had caused the great depression, and had aned to subtly change 
our form of government, o a democracy, from our original common-law (God's Law)  Republic. 
