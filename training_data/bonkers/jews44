different than torturing a man by putting him on a rack and stretching him till he confesses to a crime he 
did not commit. Only today they do it the modern way using mental torture. If a man does something 
the Government says is a crime. The Prosecuting attorney can go o the thousands of Volumes of law 
books and find  or more laws that they claim has to do with his crime, and threaten him with  or  
years in prison, if he won`t admit to a lesser crime, which will get him only  to  years in prison. He 
knows in  to  years he will loose his home, family, friends, and every thing he ever had. He might 
as well be dead. $o he admits to the lesser crime. 

My Friends that is the way the courts torture a man today in the modern way! Why does America 
have many times more lawyers per capita, than any other country in the world? Note: $alt Lake City 
alone has more lawyers than all of the Country of Japan. Does this steal our freedom? It`s not the 
Communists party that is the trouble with this country; as much as it`s the Zionist controlled Bar 
Association! GOD NOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY NEVER HAD A GREATER 
ENEMY THAN THE BAR. We have a Legal $ystem used for personal aggrandizement, without 
honor and egrity, where law and justice are no longer synonymous with separation of weres. 
Corruption of lawyers is a national disgrace in America today, where we have over  million people in 
prison, about % for drug related crimes! Every bad law or decision will eventually effe every one in 
America. In the end the only one that can a, will not be the individual, but the government through 
Judicial Immunity and Executive Privilege will be the only one that can a, who have exempted 
themselves of resnsibility and prosecution for breaking laws.

When a Judge breaks a law, who can you go to? We are fast becoming like Mexico, where there 
is no justice. Where all the judges and lice are on the take, except, here in America it is done 
under color of law. I once had a judge tell me " today in America the law is exaly what the last 
. O. B. on the bench said it was. " What has happened to our great country? According to Webster`s 
 diionary, perversion of the law for any purse by a judge is called (sophistry) (fallacious 
reasoning; reasoning; sound in appearance only.) We can observe proof of this brazen sophistry from 
the mouths, of the judges in any courtroom today, where the Judges a like POMPOUS ASS`S. 

LAWS TAKE AWAY FREEDOM 

We have a there ought to be a law mentality in America today, by misguided people that 
think laws are cure-all`s for every error. If this continues, a lice State is inevitable, and most lice 
officers, lawyers and Bankers are not against it, because it generates more money for them, and more 
were and control over the people. In reality it is like Daniel Webster said: IT IS NOT THE 
FUNCTION OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO KEEP THE CITIZEN FROM FALLING INTO ERROR; IT 
IS THE FUNCTION OF THE CITIZEN TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FROM FALLING INTO 
ERROR. 

In Jesus` time the King ordered that all babies under  years of age be killed. So who would carry 
out this order? Why the lice of course. And when the or mother would cry in protest, the liceman 
would say; Sorry lady, I am only doing my duty as they cut the babies throat. 

Today we have Police with a badge as a license to kill, armed with the most deadly magnum guns 
ever made, ready and willing to do anything they are told to do, just as it was in Jesus time. 

*Note: The Zionist CFR (Council of Foreign Relations and its upper echelon the Trilateral 
Commission), that all of the major news media and higher government officials belong to, is run and 
controlled by the Bilderburgers a secret foreign organization of the super rich world banking families 
that have become America`s shadow government. They control our government through the Council on 
Foreign Relations (CFR), a private corration and the Trilateral Commission (TC) which have litical 
dominance over America . Remember, laws and socialism are like toothpaste, once out of the 
tube, it is hard to get back in. Most of the decisions made by the judges today are socialist in 
nature. Socialism is oppressive, and every government that becomes oppressive soon falls. We must 
remember when fighting socialism, that socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, 
the economics of scarcity, and the gospel of envy. Its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery. 

Watch out for the Bankers yes man like, Slick Willy Clon`s , new lice and his 
new Police State. A New and Additional Force for Tyranny! 

We hear a lot about the Multi Jurisdiional Task Force (MJTF). That is about , new lice 
officers for each of the  States that will probably be put in front of computers to check every 
transaion made, to try to find enough people to fill all the jails and concentration camps anned, or 
already in existence, to totally enslave the nation. Welcome to the Brave New World Order and , 
only worse. What will they charge these people with? With the millions of laws, rules and regulations 
including tax laws now on the books, and the Zionist bankers trying to force us o some cash less 
society that records every transaion, making criminals of anyone they want to get out of the way, will 
not be hard. All branches of government already encourage tattle tales, stool pigeons, squealers, paid 
informants (bounty hunters, to tell on their neighbors for every conceivable infraion, of their 
unconstitutional rules and regulations (made under color of law,) offering rewards and anonymity (an 
unconstitutional guarantee that you will never have the constitutional right to face your accuser if 
hauled in to court). 

Any one with a jealousy or grudge against a neighbor can find something his neighbor may have 
done, turn him in anonymously, to some government anning, zoning, welfare agency, EPA or other 
agency from the alphabet soup from hell. This will cause the neighbor untold grief and expense, even if 
the charge is not true. Even children are encouraged to turn in their parents. Is this America the Great?

We already have , lice working full time on drug enforcement alone and they can`t 
even keep drugs out of the prisons, the most guarded aces on earth. Over a million people are in prison 
for using dope. Is this another prohibition? Did the last prohibition work? Present drug enforcement 
laws have driven the price of dmgs so high, the people that use it, are driven to violent crime to get dope. 
This hurts everyone because a large part of the crimes of theft and violence is caused by those trying to 
get the money to buy drugs. 

The naming of harmful substances such as dope is left up to the attorney General. Yet an 
addiive substance such as alcohol which lubricates and fuels the American Judicial, litical and 
business machine, and is resnsible for more crimes, ruined families, car accidents broken homes 
than all the other different kinds of dope combined is left off this list . Why? Alcohol alone costs 
the American people more money, more lives and more trouble than all other dope combined. 
Tobacco is next because of the sickness and disease it causes. It is a government proven statistical fa 
by the surgeon General, in  that smokers live  Vi years less than non smokers. They will put a 
person in jail for as much time for smoking a marijuana cigarette or taking dope, as they would for a 
major crime of premeditated violence with Mandatory sentences of  years for ssession of any tiny 
bit of dope found under the damnable Zero Tolerance law. I think any judge who gives anyone  
years in prison, for a little crime like this, should be given the free gift of the same  years in prison 
himself, to think about what he has done (stolen), from another of Gods people`s life. 

What kind of hycritical justice (injustice) do we have in this country, when the same judges and 
prosecuting attorneys imprison more than a million people, for taking dope, then go to their private club, 
bar or home, and drink alcohol and smoke tobacco a different kind of dope? If dope is wrong, and it is, 
then alcohol and tobacco are too! Why do we have a double standard? If a million + people are in jail 
on dope charges, and the same judges, lawyers and lice who put them there can drink alcohol 
and smoke tobacco a different but more harm full kind of drug; aren`t the million + in jail just 
litical prisoners? What must be the cost to the American people? And remember a lot of dope 
is anted by lice on people. The author has never taken any type of dope or smoked t. 

The real trouble is these extra , lice us slick Willy`s , new lice, used to 
enforce the dope laws today, can, and will be turned on us any day, as they advance their agenda to make 
America a lice State for the Zionist Bankers! Who are the  concentration camps already built in 
America built for. And they are building more in Alaska now. Will Alaska be America`s Siberia soon. 

The judges and prosecutors lined up to enforce this new lice State, are diabolically brilliant, 
cunning, absolutely mthless, and dangerous. These kinds of bureaucratic judges and lawyers, aing in 
the name of a government which does not recognize God, or His laws any longer, who have turned our 
Republic o a democratic diatorship, while letting our country be invaded by millions of 
illegal immigrants, bringing their heathen gods, religions, customs with them. Democracy always leads 
to martial law! Martial law means rule without constitutional law, a military or a lice diatorship. 
George Washington when trying to limit government once said; " Government is not reason; it is 
not eloquence; it is force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master." 
Government is like fire, a friendly force or a deadly foe. Afire properly handled can warm a 
family on cold days. Out of control, the same fire can burn down the house killing all the family. They 
are after our children and our freedoms. We have to stop this government! 

The men who wrote our Constitution did not found a democracy. They feared the so-called 
democrats of their day as much as we fear Communists today. Throughout history, every Civilization 
who ever turned o a Democracy, its people found they could vote money for them selves from the 
government treasury till the country went broke, and their country was taken over by a stronger country 
or people. All great civilizations have ended this way. Look at the history of Rome as an exame.
