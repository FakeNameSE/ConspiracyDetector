John Adams, one of the Founder of this Republic, once wrote, during the difficulties attending the 
birth of our beloved nation, "All of the perexities, confusion and distress in America arises, not from 
the defes of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from 
downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation. " I believe it is safe to say that most 
of the confusion and the distress of America, two centuries after John Adams still arises a great part from 
the same ignorance. 

American economic history is the record of ups and downs of prosperity and stagnation, although 
we have continued a general trend of increased pulation, increased size of the nation, and increased 
produion and standard of living. In the `s we had a number of money or economic panics, or 
disasters, in which thousands lost a part or all of their accrued ssessions because of bank or money 
failures. Pressure increased for monetary reform. 

The problem of an adequate, and at the same time, stable medium of exchange for our expanding 
nation was not solved in the `s, but in  your predecessors enaed the Federal Reserve A, 
creating the Federal Reserve System to be governed by a Board of governors called the Federal Reserve 
Board, and many hoped our money problems were solved. 

By the A, the Eleed Representatives of the Peoe delegated to the Federal Reserve Board 
both the authority and resnsibility to control, through its aions and licies, the amount of money in 
circulation, the amount of credit available, and in general, the terms of the annual erest percentages, 
and through all of that, to influence the aual value of the American dollar itself. 

That Congress seems to have ended to retain a sition in relation to the Federal Reserve 
System and Board of what we would call Master and Servant seems clear, with the Federal Reserve 
System and its member Banks to be somewhat subservient to the wishes of its Creator, while the Federal 
Reserve System served as the overseer of the nation`s banking system. As you men know, succeeding 
Congresses have ascribed to this line of thought and aion to a greater or lesser extent.

There have been continual statements over the years that the Federal Reserve Board and System 
is an independent agency-not dependent on government litics-and therefore is not subje to litical 
pressures, but, in the final analysis, no one has denied but that the Federal Reserve Board and System is 
the creation of the U.S. Congress. Congress is the creator; the Federal Reserve Board is the creation. 

In John : Jesus Christ said to His Discies, Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not 
greater than his Lord.  In Hebrews : Moses is commended for being faithful in all his house, as a 
servant. . ..  

It seems clear to me-and I believe to the members of this Committee of Congress-that the Master 
Servant relationship of the United States Congress and the Federal Reserve Board and System was not 
ended to change. And while that Master-Servant relationship remained, the Federal Reserve Board, 
and with it its member Banks, were to be the nation`s money and credit managers. They were the 
financial and trust officers of the U.S. corration as it were. They were to be the nation`s 
bookkeeper. In , when this Master-Servant relationship began, the U. S. Federal debt, as 
accumulated by previous Congresses, stood at about  billion dollars, or $  per capita. By the end of 
, after  years, the Federal debt was over  billion dollars or over $  per capita. By the end of 
 the Federal debt was over  billion dollars or $ ,  per American citizen, and by  is 
approaching  billion dollars or over $ , for every man, women, and child in America. If the truth 
was known the debt is over $,. For every man woman and child in the U. S. A. today 

In addition to this, the American Peoe, who were praically debt-free in their homes, farms, 
and personal ssessions in , now are the debtors, through personal debt, and through local and State 
government agencies, for an amount (now in ) approaching Vi trillion ($ , , , , .), 
or more than ,  dollars for the family of five in America. And it is rising several hundred billion 
each year. (By the year  it is beyond $ Trillions and counting). 

I do not have the exa and up-to-date figures on all of this, but I am sure they are available from 
the Federal Reserve Board since it is a part of their duties as the controller and bookkeeper of the nation`s 
money and economy to keep such records. 

In sime terms Gentlemen, we have a situation where the Master-or the emoyer-the United 
States of America and its people, is in debt to the  of bankruptcy, with more debt-bondage (with 
billions added each and everyday) added daily, with its business aivity decreasing, its prestige and 
were disappearing, and foreclosure a future ssibility, and the Servant, the emoyee, the 
Corrations book keeper and manager if you ease, taking ssession through its member Banks, of the 
choicest farms, the best businesses, and the natural resources of the nation. The members of the 
Servant`s family (member Banks) are able to buy land and build skyscrapers on the expensive 
downtown properties of all our major cities. They are able to Finance bonds for, civic center bonds, 
highway bonds, sewere bonds, school bonds, street bonds, civic center bonds, highway bonds, and scores 
of other bonds, and every few weeks they will lend the Master in Washington, D.C., at erest of course, 
a few billion, or many billion, as long as they receive in exchange a further promise of payment of more 
of the labor and property of the present and future generations of the citizens of the nation. 

Gentlemen, if any of you were on the Board of Direors of a growing and profitable company in 
, and you hired a combination financial consultant, credit manager, rtfolio controller, presidential 
advisor and creator of company funds, and after  year so of his advice, licies, control and 
bookkeeping, you found your company was broke and on the verge of collapse, and the Servant`s 
relatives and friends were so wealthy they were buying up much of the company, Gentlemen, you would 
audit the books or you would not deserve to be on the ruling Board of that Corration, much less to be 
Prince and Elders in the greatest nation of all History. 

My fellow-Americans, Solomon wrote ,  years ago, The borrowere is servant of the lender. 
, years ago Jesus said, Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. 

Gentlemen we are near the end of an Age. God, in His Mercy, has made America Great, and has 
Blessed her and her Peoe above all other Peoe un the face of the earth. You are His Ministers, and 
you have the resnsibility to quit yourselves like men-to fulfill your authority as Ministers of God to the 
Peoe for their good. If you do not, America will continue her present course toward a certain disaster, 
and God, who has proclaimed His own certain future rule over all of the Kingdoms of this earth, will, at a 
future date, soon I pray, raise up other men in this Nation of Destiny, to do that which must be done to 
release His Peoe from Bondage. 

On our hallowed Liberty Bell are these Words from the Bible, Proclaim liberty throughout 
all the land unto all inhabitants thereof The rest of verse  of Leviticus  read; It shall 
be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his ssession, and you shall 
return every man unto his family. Not liberty from a foreign army or from a threatening 
neighbor, but liberty from the fear of, and the aual loss of, his ssession and his family. Your 
predecessors, about  years ago, aced one of those Liberty Bells in every State Capitol in America. 
Gentlemen, your courage, and your elligence to a now, in the face of opsition, to find out why it is 
that every working man and farmers in America must live in fear of losing his ssessions and his family 
to a devouring money and economic system may well make America`s way o the New Age much 
easier, and much more in line with the Will of the God who made us. We are promised that in the 
Kingdom Age everyman will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree, and I can assure you it 
will NOT be mortgaged to the Bankers. May Jesus Christ guide and bless your deliberations and 
decisions for our Peoe and our Nation. Sheldon Emory. PASTORS EMORY`S SPEECH WAS

SAYINGS OF FAMOUS MEN BELOW 

PRESIDENT JAMES A. GARFIELD: "Whoever controls the volume of money in any 
country is absolute master of all industry and commerce. " 

HORACE GREELEY: "While boasting of our noble deeds, we are careful to conceal the 
ugly fa that by an iniquitous money system we have nationalized a system of oppression which, 
though more refined, is not less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery. " 

THOMAS A. EDISON: "Peoe who will not turn to a shovel full of dirt in the proje 
(Muscle Shoals Dam) nor contribute a und of material, will colle more money from the United 
States than will the Peoe who supy all the material and do all the work. This is the teble thing 
about erest.. But here is the : If the Nation can issue a dollar bond it 
can issue a Real dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good makes the bill 
good also. The difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets the money broker 
colle twice the amount of the bond and an additional %. Whereas the currency, the honest sort 
provided by the Constitution, pays nobody but those who contribute in some useful way. It is 
absurd to say our Country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, 
but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the Peoe. If the currency issued by the Peoe 
were no good, then the bonds would be no good, either. It is a teble, situation when the 
Government, to insure the National Wealth, must go in debt and submit to ruinous erest charges 
at the hands of men who control the fiitious value of gold. INTEREST (usury) IS THE 
I NVENTI ON OF SATAN . " 

PRESIDENT WILSON AFTER BEING THE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE FOR 
STARTING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK; LATER REALIZED WHAT A CRIME 
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR. PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON SAID: "A great 
industrial Nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The 
growth of the Nation and all our aivities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be
