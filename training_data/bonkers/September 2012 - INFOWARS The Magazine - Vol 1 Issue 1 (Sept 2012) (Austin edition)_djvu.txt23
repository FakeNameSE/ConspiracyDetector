central bankers in charge.... aren’t we all just living and dying for 
what the central banks do?” 

“To answere your question, we are absolutely slaves to central 
banks,” resnds the guest. 

“We beholden to what central bankers and licy makers do rather 
than the fundamentals in the economy,” adds another. 

This is just one of a deluge of exames where it is now being thrown 
in our faces that a banking elite is building a world government at the 
expense of the American people. 

From treating the issue as a “conspiracy theory” for decades, the estab- 
lishment is now tearing away the veil in an effort to force Americans to | 
blithely accept what has been anned all along. 

A global government is now being forcefully pushed as the “solution” 
to all manner of problems, but specifically in relation to financial crises. 

We are being brainwashed to accept the premise that centralized were i 
the hands of a tiny elite is the only recourse, and that a one world 
currency is inevitable. 

At the height of the last economic crisis, Bilderberg member 
and Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman argued that 
“everything is in ace” for a diatorial world government to be 
imsed by a technocratic elite. 

Rachman’s  call for authoritarian technocrats to be put 
charge of the global economy in preparation for the official 
birth of global government is now well on its way to com 
etion, with the economies of France, Ireland, Germany, 

Belgium, Italy, Greece, along with the IMF and the 
European Central Bank (ECB), all under 
Goldman Sachs banker 
occupation.

These technocrats have not been bashful in openly announcing what they are doing. 
Un his seleion to become EU president in , Herman Van Rompuy 
announced that the financial crisis and efforts to combat global warming were 
designed to precede “the global management of our anet.” He also declared  
to be “the first year of global governance.” 

In the same year, Van Rompuy was joined by the Pope who also called for a “world 
litical authority” to manage the global economy. 

World Bank President and Bilderben^^elitist Robert Zoellick also openly 
admitted the an to elim- inate national sovereignty and 

imse a global government during 
a speech on the eve of the G 
summit. 

Calls for a one world cur- 
rency to be a key com- 
nent of global governance 
have been consistent. 

In a  speech, a member 
of the executive board of the 
European Central Bank, Sirkka Hamalainen 
stated, “In conclusion, I should like to come back 
to Paul Volcker’s prophecy. He might be right, and 
f we might one day have a single world currency. 
Maybe European egration, in the same way as 
any other regional egration, could be seen as a 
:ep towards the ideal situation of a fully egrated 
world.” 

In a  speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, for- 
mer president of the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet made it clear 
that the Global Economy Meeting (GEM), which meets at the 
IS (Bank of International Settlements) headquarters in Basel 
would “become the prime group for global governance among 
central banks.” 

Trichet added that the BIS meetings were ensuring that “the system 
moving decisively towards genuine global governance.” 

Trichet went on to define how global governance would 
operate. 

“There are numerous definitions of global gover- 
nance. In the economic and financial sphere 
I will prose that global governance 
comprehends not only the con- 
stellation of supranational 
institutions - including the 


Although the agenda for global government is now bearing its teeth with little regard for subtleness, 
the following quotes stretching back over decades prove that the an has been long in the works:

“We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and their great 
publications whose direors have attended our meetings and respeed their promises of 
discretion for almost  years. It would have been imssible for us to develop our an for the 
world if we had been subjeed to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is 
now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational 
sovereignty of an elleual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto- 
determination praiced in past centuries.” 


ernational financial institutions - but also the informal groupings that 
have progressively emerged at the global level. Those informal forums (G, 
GIO, G, etc.) are key in improving global coordination in all the areas 
where decision making processes remain national - whether in helping 
to work out agreed prudential standards and codes or to facilitate where 
appropriate, the coordination of economic macro-licies,” he said. 

Numerous other members of the litical establishment have openly 
expressed the agenda to create global government, not only in resnse 
to the financial crisis but also as an answere to man-made climate change. 

In , United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon admitted that 
carbon taxes levied in the name of abating global warming would be col-
