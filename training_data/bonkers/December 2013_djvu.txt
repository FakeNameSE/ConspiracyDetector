FEDS DEPLOY NATIONAL SPY 
SYSTEM OF MICROPHONES 


THE YEAR MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIED 

One year ago, we feared the death of our nation at the hands of the glo- 
balist banksters. Unsatisfied with the sime conquest of national w- 
ers and litical monoly, they tightened their grip around the fleshy 

dying republic out of its consumerist coma, and our country heard us. 

each day as the propaganda peddlers of the near-extin mainstream 

left of the dinosaur media are bones left for academics to pick through.

This present crisis in consciousness has been 
getting to me. I’m not sure if it’s the computer- 
ized autonomy, the brainwashing, or the lack 
of respe that people are showing towards 
themselves and others around them. The wa- 
ter has boiled, the t is steaming, our souls 
are screaming. Who out here is awake, alert, 
or even concerned with anything else other 
than themselves? Without hesitation I can an- 
swere % of the masses. The distraions are 
enty and resolve from the self-made issues 
seem to be fleeting. To list some of the dis- 
traions without getting o specifics or in 
any particular order of imrtance we have; 
entertainment, cellphones, eyephones, srts 
(man’s soap opera), litics, cars, clothes, 
jewelry, religion, and of course the envy of 
others. Can we be expeed to have free- 
thought with any true creativity if we are bred 
to live in servility and obedience?

Hi Infowars Magazine, What I’m tired of is 
all the satanic music, that many kids admire. 
And they look up to the “artists.” We have the 
same stuff on the charts over here in Denmark 
that you guys do. For exame Rick Ross who 
talks about drug-raping women. But I have 
some much better alternatives, for exame 
MC Jin. A Christian rapper who’s now out of 
the stlight. Because he had too much per- 
sonality for the industry.

I want to share my experience with drop- 
ping off copies of the mag at Starbucks this 
A.M. I brought  copies and put one on a 
coue tables and then  next to the com- 
munity books. Almost instantly, a middle 
aged woman picked up a copy and took it 
with her to a table and began reading it  
anually reading it  while she drank her 
coffee! SCORE!!!! It literally gave me goose- 
bumps to know that I may have frees some- 
one’s mind. Not a minute later, the raging 
trendy liberal picks up a copy, takes one look 
at Prozac the Killer Clown and says, “Ohh 
my gaaawwd, look at THIS! LOOOK at this.” 
and promptly handed it to the manager who 
promptly threw it away. I was happy that the 
trendy lady didn’t notice the other  copies 
that were hanging around. Perhaps the next 
cover should just be all black with “For- 
bidden Information” on the front like the 
bumper sticker? I also finally received my 
iodine and it’s anually delicious  tastes 
like honey. I will rert back my results.

THE DANGERS WHICH ARE CITED TO JUSTIFY IT. EVEN TO-

A CLOSED SOCIETY BY IMITATING ITS ARBITRARY RESTRIC-

THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION IF OUR TRADITIONS DO NOT 
SURVIVE WITH IT. AND THERE IS VERY GRAVE DANGER THAT 
AN ANNOUNCED NEED FOR INCREASED SECURITY WILL BE 
SEIZED UPON BY THOSE ANXIOUS TO EXPAND ITS MEAN- 
ING TO THE VERY LIMITS OF OFFICIAL CENSORSHIP AND 
CONCEALMENT ... FOR WE ARE OPPOSED AROUND THE

THAT RELIES PRIMARILY ON COVERT MEANS FOR EXPAND- 
ING ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE ... IT IS A SYSTEM WHICH 
HAS CONSCRIPTED VAST HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURC-

Will Americans 
Put Up With the 
Military Being 
framed to 
Attack Them? 

The Answere May Unfortunately Be a 
Resounding “Yes” 



A s evidence mounts that 
the U.S. military is being 
trained to engage citizens 
domestically, the lack of 
outcry from the American 
people has been astounding. 

Exaly why the military is undergoing 
training in this regard is still unclear. It 
could be related to a tential welfare 
state collapse, which could be triggered 
by cuts to food stamps or social security 
benefits. According to the Social Security 
Administration, “ out of  individuals 
age  and older receive Social Security 
benefits.” The arms buildup could also be 
in resnse to the slow motion financial 
collapse, which can only be accelerated 
through the imementation of Obamacare 
and which banks have already been 
warned to prepare for. 

Another ssibility is that the military is 
gearing up for another type of staged false 
flag event, which is desperately needed to 
relieve Obama’s flagging approval rating, 
and which will in turn help further instill 
fear in Americans and keep them looking 
to government for solutions. A gun 


confiscation offensive targeting “bitter 
dingers,” tea party conservatives, or 
“conspiracy theorists” who suprt 
the Second Amendment is also not 
cometely out of the piure, as one 
Military Policeman in Arizona recently 
confirmed to Infowars. 

No matter the exanation, a few 
things are clear. Ammunition, lethal 
and nonlethal firearms, and riot gear 
are being stockpiled at an alarming 
rate, along with checks, military 
vehicles, and armed personnel for 
federal buildings. Confirmed rumors 
that the military is weeding out 
several generals and enlistees using a 
“litmus test” to gauge whether or not 
they will fire un American citizens, 
in addition to using shooting range 
targets depiing armed pregnant 
women, children, and elderly citizens 
in residential settings, and domestic 
training exercises and army manuals, 
only exacerbate woes that the 
government is preparing for imminent 
civil unrest. 

While Infowars and others 


have diligently documented these 
unprecedented developments, the sleeping 
giant that is the American people has 
thus far failed to offer a reciprocal 
resnse through protest, aivism, or 
other means. The question must be asked: 
will Americans put up with their own 
countrymen attacking them? All signs 
unfortunately  to a resounding “yes.” 

Americans already have comete apathy 
towards eugenicist praices caed out 
by the likes of Planned Parenthood in the 
form of abortion, sterilization, and other 
artificially induced procedures. 

Americans are already putting up with 
cops that condu proology exams on the 
side of the road and forced colonoscopies 
inside hospitals. 

Americans already put up with 
bureaucrats repeatedly and unalogetically 
lying to them on a near daily basis. 

Americans already put up with a 
government that ships arms and funds 
to foreign mercenaries, such as the al- 
Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria 
and other parts of the world, while they 
simultaneously promote gun control

within their own borders. 

Americans already put up with a federally 
funded domestic spy network and tech 
software which ubiquitously monitors and logs 
conversations, phone calls, texts, emails, and 
web pages visited. 

Americans already put up with degrading so-called 
security procedures, like the TSA sticking hands 
down their pants, snapping naked x-ray photos 
of them and grabbing their genitals, all the while 
gradually moving outside the scope of airrts. 

Americans already put up with massive wealth 
redistribution schemes, like Obamacare which, 
under the guise of wanting to keep everyone 
healthy, is anually set up to annihilate the 
middle class through increased taxation. 


Indeed, it seems Americans know no 
limit when it comes to allowing the federal 
government to further erase liberties in the 
name of safety, aivities which far exceed 
what America’s forebearers initiated a revolt 
over. A domestic standing army aimed at 
the American people can only be stopped if 
enough people are awake to it. 

Something I missed? The conversation 
continues on Twitter with the hashtag: 
#AmericansAlreadyPutUpWith, where 
everyone is urged to describe other ways in 
which the American people have stood down 
while their rights and liberties were slowly 
stripped away.

PRINT JOURNALISM IS FAST 
BECOMING A DISTANT MEMORY 
AS THE ESTABLISHMENT PRESS 
RAPIDLY LOSES ITS AUDIENCE TO 
INDEPENDENT MEDIA OUTLETS ON 
THE INTERNET.

Establishment Seeks to Assimilate or 
Eliminate Independent Media 



T he dinosaur media is in terminal 
decline, but it will not go down 
without a fight, which is why 
the establishment is relying on a 
number of different techniques 
to remain relevant while strangling its 
competition. Recent lls show that trust in 
mainstream media is hovering at record lows. 
Pr journalism is fast becoming a distant 
memory as the establishment press rapidly 
loses its audience to independent media 
outlets on the Internet. 

Far from accepting its fate meekly, the 
system has rolled out the big guns in a 
desperate bid to either eliminate or assimilate 
the burgeoning alternative press. The latest 
exame is buried within the secretive Trans- 
pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) and 
concerns “elleual property enforcement.” 
Put simy, the agreement will mandate ISPs 
to remove online content without the need 
for a burden of proof or any kind of legal 
process, greasing the skids for aggressive and 
disprortionate censorship-driven takedowns. 

“If instituted, the TPP’s IP regime would 
trame over individual rights and free 
expression, as well as ride roughshod over 
the elleual and creative commons,” 
reads a Wikileaks statement. “If you read, 
write, publish, think, listen, dance, sing, 
or invent; if you farm or consume food; if 
you’re ill now or might one day be ill, the 
TPP has you in its crosshairs.” 


Another way the mainstream media is 
trying to strangle alternative voices that 
might challenge its narrative is by phasing 
out or banning article comments altogether. 
Studies confirm that article comment 
seions  for better or worse  are 
heavily swaying public opinion. 

Popular Science and BoingBoing.net recently 
announced their decision to kill comment 
seions on their website. The New York Times 
also recently indicated that it is scaling back 
comments and removing them from some 
articles altogether. As an excellent Daily Tech 
piece highlights, Popular Science admitted 
that its decision to pull the comment seion 
was in order to preach a “scientific dorine” 
on global warming without being challenged. 
The move to kill off comments altogether 
comes after a largely failed attempt on behalf 
of major companies and governments around 
the world to hire armies of paid emoyees 
to troll comments by disseminating pro- 
establishment sitions in a bid to shift 
pular perceptions. 

In , the Canadian government 
announced it would, “monitor online chatter 
about litical issues and corre what it 
perceives as misinformation.” Turkey, Israel, 
and China are just some of the governments 
openly hiring paid trolls to steer public 
opinion, while the Pentagon announced 
earlier this year that it is stepping up its 
public relations efforts in order to counter 


scandals about the U.S. government emerging 
on huge, but non-establishment, news outlets 
like the Drudge Rert. 

In , it was also revealed that the U.S. 
government, “contraed HBGary Federal 
for the development of software which 
could create multie fake social media 
profiles to manipulate and sway public 
opinion on controversial issues by promoting 
propaganda.” Another way the establishment 
media will look to reassert itself is by sing 
as alternative media  funding news outlets 
that purrt to be independent yet are backed 
by government or corrate cash. 

Large mainstream news organizations like 
ITN are busy creating offshoot atforms that 
present themselves as “citizen journalism” yet 
are ultimately bankrolled and controlled by 
the establishment media itself. Meanwhile, 
large news organizations that initially 
operated somewhat outside of the influence of 
the establishment media, like The Huffington 
Post, are being quickly swallowed up by giant 
corrations like AOL. 

The mainstream media will attempt to use all 
of these methods and more to either supant 
or destroy independent voices that are not 
controlled by the establishment, which is why 
independent media needs to be more watchful 
than ever if the Internet is to remain a bastion 
of free speech and continue to provide a 
genuine alternative to the corrate press.

United Nations 
“Peacekeepers” Will Now Go 
on the Offensive in Africa 


Fresh Blood for the Ongoing Move to Pilfer Africa’s Resources.

war-torn Congo, The Washington Times rerted late last 
week. They will no longer simy stand on the sidelines, 
but will take an aive role in the warfare between rival 
tribal groups. “To be a peacekeeper doesn’t mean you 
need to be passive,” General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz told the 
newspaper. “To be a peacekeeper, you need to take aion. The way to 
prote the civilians is to take aion. If you see the history of atrocities 
here, it justifies aion.” 

Formerly, the globalist organization did its best to present a neutral 
presence as favored governments and handpicked proxies engaged in 
military aion. Stakes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, however, 
are high. It is a mineral rich area where much of the world’s coltan is 
mined. Coltan, short for columbite-tantalite and known industrially as 
tantalite, is used to manufaure tantalum capacitors used in eleronics, 
especially cell phones. 

The CIA has worked behind the scenes for decades in the Congo. 

It began with the assassination of the country’s first prime minister 
after independence from Belgium, the socialist Patrice Lumumba. The 
United Nations worked hand-in-glove with the United States and the 
CIA to destabilize the Congo and set it up for the bloody confli that 
continues there today. Since the establishment of Africom, the U.S. 

Africa Command, and the imrtation of al-Qaeda and other CIA-created 
terror groups in northern Africa, a renewed emphasis has been aced on 
stepped-up balkanization and pacification of the continent. 

Congolese “minerals are vital to maaining U.S. military dominance, 
economic prosperity, and consumer satisfaion,” write Dena Montague 
and Frida Began. “Because the United States does not have a domestic 
supy of many essential minerals, the U.S. government identifies 
sources of strategic minerals, particularly in Third World countries, then 
encourages U.S. corrations to invest in and facilitate produion of the 
needed materials.” 

In fa, the U.S. government is owned and operated by the global elite 
and their transnational corrations and bankster institutions, not other

way around. As should be readily apparent, 
a once affluent American middle class, 
thanks to decades of prosperity, financed 
the expansion of the U.S. military and its 
proxies o resource rich areas. The U.S. 
has consistently aed as an enforcer for the 
global financial and corrate elite. 

Montague and Began continue, “Tantalum, 
also referred to as coltan, is a particularly 
valuable resource  used to make mobile 
phones, night vision goggles, fiber optics, and 
capacitors (the comnent that maains 


the elerical charge in computer chips). In 
fa, a global shortage of coltan caused a 
wave of parental panic in the United States 
[in] Christmas [of ] when it resulted in 
the scarcity of the pular PlayStation . The 
Democratic Republic of the Congo holds  
percent of the world’s coltan reserves, more 
than  percent of the world’s cobalt, and the 
world’s largest supy of high-grade copper.” 
A ramped up U.N. military sture 
not only threatens the sovereignty of 
Africans, but other people who might 


resist the geolitical machinations 
of the elite. The U.S. military, while 
still a tent force on the world 
stage, has weakened considerably in 
the wake of more than a decade of 
military adventure, primarily in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. A fresh infusion of 
“peacekeepers” will be needed to enforce 
the next phase of globalist domination 
as China makes serious moves on the 
continent and the western global elite 
move to counter it.

F ormer Navy SEAL Ben Smith 
warns that the Obama admin- 
istration is asking top brass in 
the military if they would be 
comfortable with disarming U.S. 
citizens, a litmus test that includes gauging 
whether they would be prepared to order 
NCOs to fire on Americans. Smith provoked 
headlines last week when he appeared on Fox 
News to assert that the federal government 
was trying to provoke veterans o violence 
as an excuse to imement martial law 
Speaking exclusively on the “Alex Jones 
Show,” Smith stated, “Going back to the 
beginning of this administration, I’ve had 


friends within the community talking about 
how they were brought in and questioned 
with people from more towards the top side 
and the questioning . . . where it was - 
ing was do you feel comfortable disarming 
American citizens,” adding that this was one 
of the many “funny things” occung within 
the military 

When Smith was asked by radio host Alex 
Jones if this line of questioning included a 
litmus test whereby military officers were 
asked if they would fire on U.S. citizens, he 
resnded in the affirmative. Smith said the 
litmus test was related to the recent firing of 
top military commanders Navy Vice Admiral 


Tim Giardina and Major General Michael 
Carey. Smith linked the premise to former 
Obama advisor Van Jones, who was forced to 
resign in September  after his links with 
a Marxist organization were revealed. “You 
drop the radical se for the radical ends,” 
said Smith, paraphrasing Van Jones. 

The idea of U.S. soldiers being asked if they 
will fire on American citizens during a crisis 
or mass disarmament program has emerged 
from several different sources over the last 
two decades. 

In January,  Nobel Peace Prize nominee 
Jim Garrow claimed he was told by a top mil- 
itary veteran that the Obama administration’s

Military Leaders Asked if They 
Will Disarm Americans 

Litmus Test Includes Question of Whether Top Brass Are Comfortable With 
Ordering NCOs to Fire on U.S. Citizens 

written by: Paul Joseph Watson & Kit Daniels 


“litmus test” for new military leaders is 
whether or not they will obey an order to fire 
on U.S. Citizens. The survey was subsequently 
leaked because many of the Marines who took 
it were shocked by the tone of the question. 

Concerns over U.S. troops being given 
orders to fire on American citizens in the 
event of mass gun confiscation first arose 
in May  when hundreds of Marines at 
 Palms, California, were given a survey 
as part of an academic proje by Navy 
Lieutenant Commander Ernest Guy Cun- 
ningham which asked the Marines if they 
would “fire un U.S. citizens who refuse 
or resist confiscation of firearms banned 
by the United States government.” 

Infowars also received and confirmed the 
identity and authenticity of a video shot in 
September  by a member of the U.S. 
Army military lice in Arizona, showing an 
army commander briefing the MPs on their 
new command struure under the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
and the Department of Homeland Security 
for domestic operations with the National 
Guard. The MP began recording the ex- 
change after being shocked to hear that they 
were now under FEMA control. 

In the video, you can clearly hear the 
commander discuss the suspension of the 


Constitution for martial law and gun confis- 
cations in America. In essence, the military 
lice is to provide security for FEMA while the 
agency confiscates our guns during a govern- 
ment-declared domestic crisis. “They did that 
in Katrina, right,” the commander said. “They 
just go on and take away people’s guns.” 

This is yet another piece of the larger 
pattern of demonization of gun owners, 
libertarians, conservatives, Christians, 
and anyone who will not bow down to 
enslavement by a hijacked government 
occupied by ruthless tyrants who desire 
only total control. 

The hijacked federal government has been 
meticulously preparing for martial law at 
a breakneck speed. Last year, a leaked U.S. 
Army manual entitled FM -. Internment 
and Resettlement Operations outlined the 
resnsibilities of army “PSYOP” officers to 
indorinate “litical aivists” o having an 
“appreciation of U.S. licies” while they are 
detained at detention camps within America. 

Another training manual demonized Amer- 
icans who embrace individual liberties as 
tential “extremists” and even referred to the 
Founding Fathers as exames of “extremists” 
in history. The Washington U.S. Army Civil 
Disturbance Operations Manual from  
broke down how military assets on U.S. soil 


will be used to confiscate firearms, put down 
riots, and even kill Americans. This manual 
listed weans to be used against American 
“dissidents,” including “anti-riot” grenades, 
and emphasized that “warning shots will not 
be fired.” 

Earlier this year, Law Enforcement Targets, 
Inc., a provider of shooting targets to DHS 
and other federal agencies, sold a line of 
realistic-looking, “non-traditional” targets of 
pregnant women, children, and the elderly. 
One target in particular depied a pregnant 
woman standing inside a nursery. These 
targets are designed to condition law enforce- 
ment o shooting these American “threats” 
without hesitation. 

In addition to buying shooting targets of 
Americans, DHS also bought two billion 
rounds of ammunition for domestic opera- 
tions last year. This excessive amount, enough 
to sustain the war in Iraq for  years, will 
ensure the rapid expansion of the lice state 
during the civil chaos caused by the likely 
economic collapse of America. 

We’ve already seen a lice state takeover 
after the Boston Bombings, when armored 
lice went door-to-door to enter and search 
homes without a warrant. The hijacked fed- 
eral government is simy shedding our con- 
stitutional republic and purging what remains

A ward-winning scientist David 
Suzuki has gone on record in a 
public talk sted online early 
November saying that in the 
event of another seven or above 
earthquake, which he claims has about a  
percent chance of occung over the next three 
years, it would mean a comete evacuation of 
North America and destruion of Japan. “I have 
seen a paper which says that if in fa the fourth 
ant goes under in an earthquake and those 
rods are exsed, it’s bye bye Japan, and every- 
body on the west coast of North America should 
evacuate,” Suzuki said. 


As a recipient of  significant academic 
awards and a host of the pular CBC Televi- 
sion program entitled “The Nature of Things,” 
Suzuki was a headline speaker at the “Letting 
in the Light” scientific symsium that was 
focused around water ecology at the University 
of Alberta. Instead of simy discussing marine 
or freshwater ecosystems, Suzuki began issuing 
a very serious warning regarding the future of 
Fukushima and its overall predied consequenc- 
es for the entire anet. Specifically speaking to 
the nature of Fukushimas ticking time bomb, 
Suzuki began the breakdown of the ants nu- 
merous threats with stating the very real concept 


that Fukushima is perhaps the largest threat to 
both humanity and the anet that we face in the 
immediate future. 

“Fukushima is the most tefying situation 
I can imagine,” he said before delving o 
the issue. “Three out of the four ants were 
destroyed in the earthquake and in the tsunami. 
The fourth one has been so badly damaged that 
the fear is, if there’s another earthquake of a 
seven or above, that that building will go and 
then all hell breaks loose . . . And the probability 
of a seven or above earthquake in the next three 
years is over  percent.” 

It is that  percent chance of another seven or

Award-Winning Scientist Says Another . Earthquake Hitting

above earthquake within the next three years that 
signals a cometely dark scenario, but, as right as 
Suzuki is on this entire issue, he is also forgetting 
another threat  TEPCO s mission to launch 
their cleanup operation of the Fukushima site. 
Specifically, their move to begin the extraion 
of fuel rods from the fourth reaor at the ant. 

It is here where we also see yet another looming 
danger in regards to the cleanup process that is 
expeed to ultimately take decades: the ssibil- 
ity of two rods colliding and generating a massive 
release of radiation as a result. 

Experts like Dr. Helen Caldicott have sken 
to the media on this subje in the past, stating 


that “two rods could touch each other in this 
process, which has been done before, and there 
could be a fission reaion and a very large 
release of radiation.” 

Ultimately, the fa of the matter is that the 
Fukushima ant is teetering on the equivalent of 
nuclear life suprt, and the notoriously incom- 
petent ant operators at TEPCO are about to go 
in and perform surgery. In the event that Suzuki 
is right and another earthquake hits within the 
next three years before TEPCO is able to perform 
a cleanup (which may very well be even more 
dangerous), leading to a comete meltdown, it 
would absolutely lead to a radioaive disaster 


ernationally  well beyond Japan and even 
the United States. 

But don’t count on your government health 
bodies to inform you of the risk or even tell you 
how you can better prepare yourself. Instead, they 
will likely start shutting off their radiation count- 
ers once again and raising the allowable limits of 
radiation in the food supy. For now, it is up to us 
to prepare ourselves and our family  making an 
effort to also spread the word and call on the pub- 
lic to demand aion be taken in Fukushima under 
the guidance of top independent scientists.

The Death Throes 
of Media Control 

Mainstream Media Is Losing the War for Your Mind 
written by: Kit Daniels 



he Constitution describes a 
government that is now extin. 
Instead of a constitutional 
republic of limited weres, 
we now have a bureaucratic 
oligarchy of unlimited weres vested to 
over  uneleed heads of various federal 
agencies. The Founding Fathers understood 
that such an unlimited government will 
continuously create regulations which 
leech on the produivity of the American 
people until there is nothing left, leaving the 
country cometely destroyed. That is why 
they wrote the Constitution as a framework 
to put limits on the exercise of litical 
were, yet we are now living under the very 
scenario which they had then feared. 


This descent o tyranny really began to ac- 
celerate in the s and ’s when Congress 
started granting executive, legislative, and ju- 
dicial were to regulatory commissions which 
are largely unchecked and unchallenged 
by Congress, the courts, and the American 
people. But why didn’t Americans at the time 
stand up against this? In those decades, li- 
ticians, bankers, and media moguls began to 
suppress organized resistance to their agenda 
by “manufauring” consent from Americans 
through propaganda techniques developed 
during World War I. 

At the time, Walter Lippmann, a journalist 
and litical commentator, declared that in 
order to “advance” democracy, it was vital to 
persuade Americans to agree to things that 
they did not want. This “advancement” of 
democracy leads away from the limited con- 
stitutional republic that our founders created, 
which is precisely what the elite ended. 
Unlimited government requires that the 
pulation relinquish control over their own 
affairs and be kept disorganized and distra- 
ed through purseful deception. 

Lippmann and others developed the view 
that only the elite had the elle and ratio- 
nality to decide the public’s best erests. To 
them, the public, the overwhelming majority 
of the American people, were simy too 
dumb to manage their own affairs and there- 
fore must be led like cattle towards the future 
world envisioned by those in control. 

Not considered the decision-makers, the 
American people are meant to be mere spea- 
tors in society, only participating on occasion 
during litical eleions to decide which 
one of the elites will “represent” them. The 
mainstream media, serving the elite, works 
to control the public’s mind by keeping them 
distraed with meaningless issues that en- 
courage in-fighting amongst themselves while 
the establishment gains more ground without 
adversity. 

Mass entertainment, such as sitcoms and 
srts, also allow Americans to divert their 
attention away from reality to the benefit of 
the elite. The left-right paradigm, another 
tool of the establishment, oversimifies the 
public’s perception of the world so that they 
falsely believe that everything is simy black 
and white, one extreme against the other, red 
vs. blue. While stuck in the paradigm, people 
are led to believe that their opnents only 
exist on the opsite side of the sperum 
and are cometely unaware of the real were

struure towereing above. 

The purse of all of this is to keep individ- 
uals from organizing under a common cause 
against the establishment. As long as they are 
isolated and fighting amongst themselves, 
individuals will not resist tyranny even when 
they can do so successfully. Yet the elite has 
not been cometely successful in keeping 
everyone separated and under control. 

As we’ve recently seen from the Ron Paul 
campaign and other pular liberty move- 
ments, a new era of organized resistance is 
emerging. Americans who desire real change 
are discovering that there are others just like 
them willing to stand up for the truth. We 
only have to look at the continuous ratings 
decline of cable news networks and the um- 
meting Congressional approval rating to see 
that this resistance is working. 

In September, Nielsen Media Research 
revealed that MSNBC’s viewereship declined 
during the third quarter of , with total 
day ratings down  percent and primetime 
ratings down  percent. The network’s 
signature program, “The Rachel Maddow 
Show,” drew its lowest-rated quarter ever in 
that period. 

Another news network, CNN, recorded its 
lowest ratings in  years in . During 
a panel discussion that year at a trade show 
for cable television, Steve Scully, a C-Span 
producer, asked CNN anchor John King to 
describe CNN’s audience. “Well, fewere people 
at the moment, which is part of our chal- 
lenge,” King said according to The Washing- 
ton Examiner. “You can laugh all you want . . . 
It’s a challenge.” 

Although the network made a rebound this 
year and is consistently sting higher ratings 
than MSNBC, Mediabistro.com rerted re- 
cently that CNN has been struggling as of late. 
The web site also rerted in August that Fox 
News had the highest ratings in cable news, 
but the network suffered from year-over-year 
losses in viewereship. Furthermore, Mediabis- 
tro.com stated that the network sted its 
lowest rating in the age  to  demographic 
since  during that month. 

An even more telling trend is the decline in 
believability ratings for all of these networks. 
Pew Research Center revealed that from 
 to , CNN’s rating dropped from  
percent to  percent, MSNBC went from  
percent to  percent and Fox News fell from 
 percent to  percent. Since , these 
ratings have been declining steadily, with only

a tiny uptick in  which has since been 
lost. 

Congress is also viewed orly in the 
public’s eye. Real Clear Politics rerted 
that the Congressional job approval rating 
is now in the single-digits at  percent as of 
this writing and the disapproval rating is at 
an unprecedented . percent. 

Despite the elite’s attempts to control 


the public’s mind through mass media and 
other avenues of entertainment, people are 
beginning to think for themselves rather 
than accept lies and misinformation without 
question. Americans are waking up from their 
slumber induced by deception and those in 
were are being held accountable for their 
lies.

now happening for real in the U.S.  except it isn’t 
confined to airrts, it is being caed out by lice 
on the streets and by doors in hospitals at the behest 
of law enforcement officials. 

The stories have centered on New Mexico, where 
not one, not two, but three cases of law enforcement 
officials enforcing humiliating and demeaning anal 
probes and body cavity searches without consent 
have been rerted in recent weeks. By far the most 
appalling of these cases was that of David Eckert, who 
was subjeed to  hours of medical probes at the 
hands of doors following orders from deputies with 


a “search warrant” from a judge. 

The medical rert released as part of the case 
indicates that lice ordered doors to carry out no 
less than eight anal and abdominal searches, consisting 
of two x-rays, two anal penetration examinations 
by hand, three enemas, forcing Eckert to defecate in 
front of doors and lice each time, and finally a full 
colonoscopy, involving insertion of a camera o his 
anus, reum, colon, and large estine. At no  
were any drugs discovered. Eckert never gave consent for 
any of the procedures to be caed out and was vocally 
resistant throughout. The lice and doors involved are 
now facing a hefty lawsuit with the ssibility of those 
involved being sacked and banned from law enforcement 
and the medicine praice respeively. 

While Eckert’s attorneys are questioning whether a

Eckert’s crime? He did not come to a comete 
stop at a stop sign. After pulling Eckert over, officers 
approached with a drug sniffing dog which alerted to

doubt is the fa that the hofic medical procedures 
were caed out in a different county than the one 
in which the said warrant had apparent jurisdiion. 


suggested Eckert was “clenching his buttocks” and that hours after the warrant had expired. 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


 





“This is like something out of a 
science fiion film, anal probing 
by government officials and public 
emoyees,” said Eckert’s attorney, 
Shannon Kennedy, who is arguing 
that there was not sufficient probable 
cause in the case. “If the officers 
in Hidalgo County and the City of 
Deming are seeking warrants for 
anal cavity searches based on how 
they’re standing, and the warrant 
allows doors at the Gila Hospital of 
Horrors to go in and do enemas and 
colonoscopies without consent, then 
anyone can be seized, and that’s why 
the public needs to know about this,” 
the attorney added. 


But this was not the end of the 
story. Eckert’s attorney has uncovered 
another case almost identical to his 
ordeal, involving a second man being 
forcefully anally probed at the hands 
of the same lice department and 
the same doors. After not using his 
blinker at a junion, Timothy Young 
was pulled over by cops in Lordsburg, 
New Mexico, and subjeed to a search 
involving the very same drug sniffing 
dog that featured in Eckert’s ordeal. 
When the dog again alerted, Young 
was shipped off to the Gila Regional 
Medical Center and subjeed to anal 
exams and x-rays of his stomach, 
without giving his consent. The 


examinations again turned up nothing, 
and it again turned out that the 
“search warrant” obtained by the cops 
was issued in a different county to 
where the medical exams took ace. 

The attorney in Eckert’s case also 
discovered that that the drug sniffing 
dog’s certification expired in  and 
was never renewed. The law states 
that drug dogs must be re-certified 
every year. “We have done public 
requests to find anything that would 
show this dog has been trained. We 
have evidence that this dog has had 
false alerts in the past,” Kennedy said. 

Following ense media coverage, 
a third person from New Mexico, this 




time a woman, has come forward with a 
similar story. Representing the woman, 
who wishes to remain anonymous, the 
ACLU states that federal border patrol 
agents pressed their fingers o her 
vagina and anus without consent and 
without a warrant, following a drug dog 
alerting to her at a Port of Entry from 
Juarez, Mexico, o El Paso, Texas. 

The agents are said to have stripped 
searched the woman at their facility, 
asked her to spread her genitalia and 
to cough. Female agents also allegedly 
pressed their fingers o her vagina 
looking for drugs, but turned up nothing. 
Medical records examined by the ACLU 
revealed that the woman did not consent 
to the strip search or having her private 
parts sexually molested. The woman’s 
ordeal then continued as the agents 
delivered her to the University Medical 
Center of El Paso. 

“First, medical staff observed her 
making a bowel movement, and no drugs 
were found at that ,” said Laura 
Schaur Ives, Legal Direor for the New 
Mexico Chapter of the ACLU. “They 
then took an x-ray, but it did not reveal 
any contraband. They then did a cavity 
search and they probed her vagina and 
her anus, they described in the medical 
records as bi-manual  two handed. 
Finally, they did a cat scan. Again, they 
found nothing.” 

These cases indicate that lice are 
conduing these procedure as a matter of 
routine when a drug sniffing dog reas 
to anyone they stop. The Americans in 
these cases have been treated worse than 
prisoners would be in maximum security 
detention facilities, with total disregard 
for the Fourth Amendment, which is 
supsed to prote against unreasonable 
searches and seizures. 

It should also be noted that a prominent 
study from  found that only  
percent of all canine “alerts” turn up 
any contraband. The analysis condued 
by the Chicago Tribune also found that 
in Chicago, the number of false “alerts” 
jumped to  percent when lice were 
confronting a Latino suspe. While 
this may mean that dogs are being 
pursefully manipulated o reaing 


by discriminatory cops, a further study 
published in the January  edition 
of the scientific journal Animal Cognition 
found that dogs are overwhelmingly 
influenced by their handlers’ belief that 
drugs may be present. The author of the 
study, Lisa Lit, noted that this aspe 
“might be as imrtant  or even more 
imrtant  than the sensitivity of a 
dog’s nose” in such cases. 

The three cases described above are 
far from isolated incidents. In July of 
this year, two Houston women, made 
headlines when Texas Department of 
Transrtation (DPS) troopers performed 
embarrassing body cavity searches in ain 
view on both women along a Houston 
highway. The justification for examining 
both the women’s anuses and vaginas was 
“an odor of marijuana” in their vehicle. 

In a dash-cam video of the incident, the 
trooper is heard telling one of the young 
women “we’re about to get up close and 
personal with your womanly parts.” After 
the search was concluded the women 
comained of “severe and continuing 
pain and discomfort.” 

Even more disturbingly, the trooper did 
not change her gloves between cavity 
searches, a blatant health and safety 
violation. The two women have filed a 
federal lawsuit against the DPS and are 
currently in litigation. While the senior 
trooper was later fired, the trooper that 
followed the order to condu the cavity 
searches was reinstated to duty, following 
a short suspension, after a grand jury 
failed to indi her on any wrongdoings. 

In an almost exa reica of this case, a 
trooper named Kelley Helleson from North 
Texas was charged with two counts of 
sexual assault and two counts of official 
oppression by a Dallas County grand jury 
back in March, after carrying out a search 
of the body cavities  front and back  
of two women along an exit ramp of the 
Bush Turnpike in Irving. 

The women, Angel Dobbs, , and her 
niece, Ashley Dobbs, , were stopped 
after one of them threw a cigarette out of 
their car window. Another trooper on the 
scene, David Farrell, was charged with 
theft after one of the women comained 
that he stole her prescription bottle of 


 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


the painkiller hydrocodone. The lawsuit 
also says Helleson failed to properly 
exain the extent of the search, telling 
the women “not to worry about” why she 
was putting on blue latex gloves. DPS 
Direor Steve McCraw, who oversaw 
both the cases described above, is 
accused in the second lawsuit of failing 
to address a “long standing pattern of 
lice miscondu involving unlawful strip 
searches, cavity searches, and the like...” 

These ordeals, which amount to a 
gross violation of civil rights, make 
the TSA’s airrt groping shenanigans 
seem somewhat tame in comparison. 

In numerous other rerted cases, 
while lice are stopping short of full 
on anal and vaginal searches, they are 
still terrorizing people in the streets by 
searching inside their underwear, in 
ain view of the public. Police are also 
routinely stopping drivers and demanding 
blood, urine, and even DNA sames 
without proper authorization. 

The common faor in all of these cases 
is that lice are using the suspicion of 
a presence of narcotics as justification 
for conduing blatantly unconstitutional 
searches. Unfortunately, this is the hofic 
fallout of the over hyped “War on Drugs” 
that the government and the media 
have been drilling o the minds of law 
enforcement officials for over  years. 

Prominent non-governmental 
organization Transform Drug Policy 
Foundation summarizes the erosion 
of human rights in the face of a 
manufaured threat, “Like the War on 
Terror, the War on Drugs is framed as a 
resnse to an exceptional, existential 
threat to our health, our security, and 
indeed the very fabric of society. The 
‘addiion to narcotic drugs’ is rtrayed 
as an ‘evil’ the ernational community 
has a moral duty to ‘combat’ because it 
is a ‘danger of incalculable gravity’ that 
warrants a series of (otherwise publicly 
unacceptable) extraordinary measures. 
This is not an exaggeration of the litical 
rhetoric. This crusading language has 
created a litical climate in which drug 
war licy and enforcement are not 
required to meet human rights norms.” 

In addition to the bill of rights, every 


form of dignity is being degraded by 
design, as the phony drug war is used 
by state and federal law enforcement 
personnel as a pretext to eviscerate 
privacy, raid private property, and now, as 
we have seen, to literally rape Americans 
on the streets. 

In their influential examination of the 
“War on Drugs” researchers Jay Stanley 
and Barry Steinhardt note, “In recent 
years  in no small part as the result 
of the failed ‘War on Drugs’  Fourth 
Amendment princies have been steadily 
eroding. The circumstances under which 
lice and other government officials 
may condu warrantless searches has 
been rapidly expanding. The courts have 
allowed for increased surveillance and 
searches on the nation’s highways and 
at our ‘borders’ (the legal definition of 
which anually extends hundreds of miles 
inland from the aual border). And 
despite the Constitution’s ain language 
covering ‘persons’ and ‘effes,’ the courts 
have increasingly allowed for warrantless 
searches when we are outside of our 
homes and ‘in public.’ Here the courts have 
increasingly found we have no ‘reasonable 
expeation’ of privacy and that therefore 
the Fourth Amendment does not apy.” 

If the “War on Drugs” were a legitimate 
operation it would have long ago proven 
an unmitigated failure. However, it 
is a fake initiative, as underscored 
by information publicly released as 
part of FBI probes and Congressional 
investigations in the mid to late ’s, 
documenting the fa that U.S. federal 
agencies, including the CIA, have been 
shipping in vast quantities of illegal 
narcotics for decades with big banks

Obama’s Secret 
Iteaty Will Merge 
America Into the 
Emerging One 
World Economic 
System 


OBAMA IS TRYING TO MAKE A GIANT 
END-RUN AROUND CONGRESS ON 
DOZENS OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT 
ARE ADDRESSED BY THIS TREATY. 



D id you know that the Obama 
administration is negotiating a 
super secret “trade agreement” 
that is so sensitive that he 
isn’t even allowing members 
of Congress to see it? The Trans-Pacific 
Partnership (TPP) is being called the 
“NAFTA of the Pacific” and “NAFTA on 
steroids,” but the truth is that it is so much 
more than just a trade agreement. This 
treaty has  chapters, but only  of them 
have to do with trade. 

Most Americans don’t realize this, but this 
treaty will fundamentally change our laws 
regarding Internet freedom, healthcare, 
the trading of derivatives, copyright issues, 
food safety, environmental standards, civil 
liberties, and so much more. It will also 
merge the United States far more deey o 
the emerging one world economic system. 
Initially, twelve nations will be a party to this 
treaty including the United States, Mexico, 
Canada, Japan, Australia, Brunei, Chile, 
Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singare, 
and Vietnam. Together, those nations 
represent approximately  percent of global 
GDP. It is hoped that additional nations such 
as the Philippines, Thailand, and Colombia 
will join the treaty later on. 

There are some very good reasons why 


Obama does not want the American 
people to know anything about what is 
in this treaty. This agreement will imse 
very stri Internet copyright rules on 
the American people, it will ban all “Buy 
American” laws, it will give Wall Street 
banks much more freedom to trade 
risky derivatives, and it will force even 
more domestic manufauring offshore. 

It contains a whole host of things that 
Obama would be unable to get through 
Congress on his own, but he is hoping to 
spring this on Congress at the last minute 
and get them to agree to this “free trade 
agreement” before they realize all of the 
things that are contained in it. 

The secrecy surrounding these 
treaty negotiations have really been 
unprecedented. The following is an excerpt 
from a recent article by Kurt Nimmo: 

“Since the beginning of the TPP 
negotiations, the process of drafting 
and negotiating the treaty’s chapters 
has been shrouded in an unprecedented 
level of secrecy,” Wikileaks notes in a 
statement on the release of the TPP 
draft. “Access to drafts of the TPP 
chapters is shielded from the general 
public. Members of the U.S. Congress 
are only able to view seleed rtions

of treaty-related documents in highly restriive conditions 
and under stri supervision. has been previously 
revealed that only three individuals in each TPP nation 
have access to the full text of the agreement, while  
‘trade advisers’  lobbyists guarding the erests of large 
U.S. corrations such as Chevron, Halliburton, Monsanto, 
and Walmart  are granted privileged access to crucial 
seions of the treaty text.” 

And Obama rertedly is seeking “trade promotion 
authority” which would give him the ability to sign this 
treaty before Congress even votes on it. Aaron Klein of 
WND writes: 

“Normally free-trade agreements must be authorized 
by a majority of the House and Senate,-jusually in 
lengthy proceedings. 

“However, the White House is seeking what is known 
as “trade promotion authority” which would fast track 
approval of the TPP by requiring Congress to vote on the 
likely lengthy trade agreement within  days and without 
any amendments. 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


+ 


“The authority also allows Obama to sign the 
agreement before Congress even has a chance to 
vote on it, with lawmakers getting only a quick 
st-fao vote.” 

This is so insidious that it is hard to find 
the words to describe it. In essence, Obama 
is trying to make a giant end-run around 
Congress on dozens of different issues that 
are addressed by this treaty. Fortunately, there 
are at least some members of Congress that 
are waking up to this. Earlier in November, 
a small group of Republicans and a small 
group of Democrats both sent Obama a letter 
condemning this “free trade” agreement 
rerted on by The Huffington Post : 

“Separate groups of House Republicans and 
Democrats on Tuesday condemned the Obama 
administration’s prosed sweeping free trade 
agreement with  Pacific nations, known as the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership. 

“Strongly worded letters to President Barack 
Obama Tuesday were signed by hardline tea 
partiers, true-blue progressives, and moderate, 
corrate-friendly lawmakers in both parties, 
indicating litical trouble for a trade deal the 


administration had hoped to seal by year end.” 

This is one of the most imrtant litical 
issues facing our nation here at the end of , 
and yet you hear next to nothing about this 
treaty on the mainstream news. If this treaty is 
approved, the United States will be permanently 
bound by the provisions of this treaty and will 
never be able to change them unless all of the 
other countries agree, according to The Nation. 

“Countries would be obliged to conform 
all their domestic laws and regulations to 
the TPP’s rules  in effe, a corrate coup 
d'etat. The prosed pa would limit even 
how governments can spend their tax dollars. 
Buy America and other Buy Local procurement 
preferences that invest in the U.S. economy 
would be banned, and “sweat-free,” human 
rights, or environmental conditions on 
government contras could be challenged. If 
the TPP comes to fruition, its retrograde rules 
could be altered only if all countries agreed, 
regardless of domestic eleion outcomes or 
changes in public opinion. And unlike much 
domestic legislation, the TPP would have no 
expiration date.” 


Are you starting to understand just how 
dangerous this treaty is? Let me give you 
just one exame of how this treaty could 
direly affe you. Do you remember SOPA? 
There was a huge public backlash when the 
very stri Internet copyright provisions of 
SOPA were revealed to the public, and the 
American people loudly expressed their 
diseasure to members of Congress, but now 
the provisions of SOPA are back. Most of them 
have rertedly been very quietly inserted 
o this treaty. If this treaty is enaed, those 
provisions will become law and the American 
people will not be able to do a thing about it. 
And according to an article in The New York 
Times, there are all sorts of other disturbing 
things that have been slipped o this treaty. 

‘And yet another leak revealed that the deal 
would include even more expansive incentives 
to relocate domestic manufauring offshore 
than were included in NAFTA  a deal that 
drained millions of manufauring jobs from the 
American economy. 

“The agreement would also be a boon for 
Wall Street and its campaign to water down 



 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


regulations put in ace after the  financial 
crisis. Among other things, it would praically 
forbid bans on risky financial produs, 
including the toxic derivatives that helped cause 
the crisis in the first ace.” 

Are you starting to grasp why the Obama 
administration is so determined to keep this 
treaty such a secret? 

In addition, this “free trade” agreement will 
push the ongoing deindustrialization of America 
o overdrive. Every year, we buy hundreds 
of billions of dollars of more stuff from the rest 
of the world than they buy from us. Tens of 
thousands of American businesses have been 
lost as a result, and millions of good jobs have 
been shipped overseas. If you are not familiar 
with our “trade deficit,” you really should 
be. It is one of the issues at the very heart of 
our economic problems. Slowly merging our 
economy with the rest of the anet has been 
absolutely disastrous for America. Just consider 
the following statistics: 

) Overall, the United States has run a trade 
deficit of more than $ trillion with the rest of 
the world since . 


 ) The United States has lost more than , 
manufauring facilities since . 

 ) Back in the year , there were more than 
 million Americans working in manufauring. 
Now there are less than  million. 

 ) There are less Americans working in 
manufauring today than there was in  
even though the pulation of the country has 
more than doubled since then. 

 ) Back in , more than  percent of 
all men in the United States had jobs. Today, 
less than  percent of all men in the United 
States have jobs. 

 ) When NAFTA was pushed through Congress 
in , the United States had a trade surus 
with Mexico of $. billion. By , we had a 
trade deficit with Mexico of $. billion. 

 ) Back in , our trade deficit with China 
was approximately $ million (million with a 
little “m”) for the entire year. In , our trade 
deficit with China was $ billion. That was 
the largest trade deficit that one nation has had 
with another nation in the history of the world. 

 ) According to the Economic Policy Institute, 
America is losing half a million jobs to China 


every single year. 

 ) According to Professor Alan Blinder of 
Princeton University,  million more U.S. jobs 
could be sent offshore over the next two decades 
if current trends continue. 

Once un a time, our great manufauring 
cities were the envy of the entire anet. In fa, 
at one time Detroit anually had the highest per 
capita income in the United States. But now, 
Detroit is a rotting, decaying, festering hellhole 
that is cometely bankrupt. And there are dozens 
of other formerly great manufauring cities that 
are heading down the exa same path. These 
“free trade” agreements are neither “free” nor 
“fair” when you really examine them, and they 
are absolutely eviscerating the middle class. 

Please urge your representatives in Congress to 
block the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If this treaty 
does get approved, it is going to make a lot of 
our problems a whole lot worse.

European Union 
Set to Monitor 
“Intolerant” Citizens 

Controlling Social Behavior: Prosal Could Ban 
Criticism of Islam and Feminism 


written by: Paul Joseph Watson 



A frightening prosal 

currently being considered 
by the European Parliament 
would dire governments 
to monitor citizens deemed 
“olerant” and could even lead to a ban 
on all criticism of Islam and feminism. The 
European Framework National Statute 
for the Promotion of Tolerance, which 
was drafted by the European Council on 
Tolerance and Reconciliation, an NGO 
based in Paris, was presented to the 
European Parliament’s Civil Liberties 
committee in September and is thought to 
be on the verge of imementation. 

According to the Gatestone Institute, 
the Statute represents an “unparalleled 
threat to free speech” and would have 
the impa of “effeively shutting down 
the right to free speech in Europe” by 
banning “all critical scrutiny of Islam 
and Islamic Sharia law, a key objeive of 
Muslim aivist groups for more than two 
decades.” The main purse of the Statute 
is aimed at eliminating “anti-feminism” and 
“Islamophobia,” according to the document, 
which means that any criticism of feminist 
litical dorines or the Muslim religion 
would be considered hate speech. 

Seion  of the document states that, 
“There is no need to be tolerant to the 
olerant. This is especially imrtant as 
far as freedom of expression is concerned.” 
In other words, stamping out “olerance” 
trumps the free speech rights of millions of 
European citizens. “Faith-based groups and 


schools, adherents of a particular religion, 
or even just parents who want to teach 
their children certain moral values would 
all be put under general suspicion of being 
olerant,” warns civil rights watchdog 
European Dignity Watch. 

The prosal diates that “Members of 
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are 
entitled to a special proteion, additional 
to the general proteion that has to be 
provided by the Government to every 
person within the State.” This basically 
mandates that the free speech rights of 
European citizens need to be revoked in 
order to secure the “additional” rights of 
minority groups to not be offended by 
“olerant” remarks, which include holding 
such groups to “ridicule,” a definition which 
would presumably outlaw satire. 

The framework calls for the dorine to be 
imemented by “a special administrative 
unit” in each of the E.U.’s  member 
states that would “operate within the 
Ministry of Justice” and have the were of 
“penal sanions.” In addition, a “National 
Tolerance Monitoring Commission” would 
also be created to “promote tolerance.” 

“The princies of freedom of contra 
and the freedom to live according to one’s 
personal moral views are in danger of 
being superseded by a newly developed 
concept of ‘equality.’ It would undermine 
freedom and self-determination for all 
Europeans and subje the private life 
of citizens to legal uncertay and the 
control of bureaucrats,” states European 


Dignity Watch. “It is about governmental 
control of social behavior of citizens. These 
tendencies begin to give the impression 
of long-passed totalitarian ideas and 
constitute an unprecedented attack on 
citizens’ rights.” 

The prosal also caters for the re- 
education of individuals deemed olerant. 
“Juveniles convied of committing 
crimes . . . will be required to undergo a 
rehabilitation program designed to instill 
in them a culture of tolerance,” states the 
document. Schools from the elementary 
level upwards will also be mandated 
by governments to “roduce courses 
encouraging students to accept diversity 
and promoting a climate of tolerance 
as regards the qualities and cultures of 
others.” The prosal also calls on citizens 
to be brainwashed o “tolerance” via mass 
media, with governments ensuring that 
television networks “devote a prescribed 
percentage of their program to promoting a 
climate of tolerance.” 

The program is not only an alarming threat 
to free speech but is also deliciously ironic 
in light of comas by major E.U. weres 
about NSA monitoring of citizens and world 
leaders. Given the E.U.’s history in this 
context, it is highly probable that they will 
adopt the recommendations wholesale. Back 
in , the E.U. announced that it had the 
were to outlaw criticism of itself when the 
European Court of Justice ruled that the EU 
could “lawfully suppress litical criticism of 
its institutions and of leading figures.”

Former NSA Head 
Argues Government 
Secrecy Is the Same as 
Personal Privacy 

Says Americans Have No Right to Know What the NSA Is Doing 


n a debate with one of the leading rerters 
to have been involved in the Edward Snowden 
leaks, former NSA head Michael Hayden argued, 
ridiculously, that government secrecy is akin to an 
individual’s private privacy, and so the American 
public should not be privy to the aions of the NSA. 
Hayden was debating Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, 
blogger, and best-selling author Barton Gellman at the 
Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University in 
an event titled “Leakers or Whistlebloweres? National 
Security Rerting in the Digital Age.” 

When Gellman began to question Hayden’s assertions, 
calling them misleading, Hayden became noticeably 
uncomfortable and even angry, at one  shouting over 
the top of Gellman. In an egregious claim, Hayden stated, 
“There are necessary secrets. Our society recognizes privacy 
or secrecy for a variety of institutions. We do priest/penitent. 
We do lawyer/client. We do husband/ wife. I mean, we 
recognize that for the greater good, some things need to be 
kept out of the public domain. Those are more in the sense 
of personal privacy, but privacy to an individual is what 
secrecy is to a state. Both are necessary, and both can be 
abused. Fully aware, alright, that both can be abused.” 
Essentially, Hayden is claiming that the inalienable right 
of an individual to privacy, guaranteed to him or her under 
the Constitution, can be extended to government agencies, 
including the NSA  a patently absurd claim, particularly 
if the government is using secrecy as a cover for tentially 
illegal aivity. Hayden also renewed his personal hate 
campaign against Edward Snowden, claiming that Snowden 
accepted a role at the NSA with a “preconceived notion” 
that the agency was doing wrong and that he must exse 
it, rather than because he “discovered something which 
offended him.” 

“The agencies weren’t doing anything illegal. They 


weren’t doing anything unconstitutional. They were just 
doing things that offended him.” Hayden stated. Hayden 
has previously made this claim several times without 
backing it up, going as far as floating a conspiracy 
theory that Snowden was likely engaged in a “sustained, 
long-term campaign” to take information from the NSA, 
with the contraor moving from job to job to gain more 
access. Meanwhile, back in reality, all public profiles of 
Snowden suggest that the exa opsite is true, that 
he was simy a patriot working for the government 
who discovered the NSA was engaged in a mass spying 
campaign against Americans. 

Gellman, a former Washington Post rerter, was one of 
the only journalists to have had initial access to Snowden’s 
material, along with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. 
He led the revelations on the NSA’s mass spying program 
known as PRISM. Hayden referred to Gellman’s aions 
as “the most destruive” in the whole affair, saying that 
the information was direly useful to terrorists targeting 
America. “Many legitimate elligence targets  we 
learned two days ago that Yahoo and Google are ... were 
the ernet providers of choice for terrorists world wide.” 

Hmmm, so al-Qaeda uses Yahoo email. Really? 

And even if it does, good, that means they should be 
easily monitored. 

Close to an hour o the debate Hayden lost it 
cometely and began shouting at Gellman, stating “This 
was the most produive source of communications 
elligence that NSA had. Your privacy was not involved 
 other than the fa that you use Google or Yahoo  
but your emails, your accounts, were not the ones being 
accessed.” When Gellman attempted to erje, Hayden 
bawled “No, no. I chose my word ... No! I chose my words 
carefully. Your accounts were not being accessed.” 

In his resnse, Gellman noted that the NSA colles tens 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 



of millions of communications including those 
of innocent Americans and that it is not the 
ace of the NSA to assume that Americans 
should be happy with this, or that it should be 
kept secret. 

Hayden has previously made it known 
that he believes Snowden to be worse than 
any American “traitor” ever, including 
Benedi Arnold, for blowing the whistle on 
government spying. He has said that he does 
not see Snowden as a whistleblowere because 
he has not “exsed any wrongdoing” by 
government. As we detailed in an earlier 
article on Infowars.com, Hayden has publicly 
declared that he would love to see Snowden 
aced on a U.S. government kill list. Hayden 
has also described the former NSA contraor 


as a “morally arrogant defeor” who will 
likely become an alcoholic. 

Of course, it was Hayden who was 
overseeing warrantless wiretapping programs 
during his tenure at the NSA. He was the one 
in charge of spying on millions of Americans’ 
communications, relying on a truly twisted 
version of the law under the PATRIOT A as 
cover for his aions. Hayden was also the 
man who seriously argued that there was no 
mention of “probable cause” in the Fourth 
Amendment, insisting that only “reasonable 
search and seizure” was required in violating 
the privacy of Americans. 

Sorry, who is the “morally arrogant traitor” 
again?

Fear Drives Journalists 
to Cowere Into 
Self-Censorship 

The Global Elite Shapes Flow of Information 
Through Intimidation of Journalists 


T he Stasi surveillance state, 

exemified by NSA snooping, 
has very little if anything to 
do with terrorists. Like all 
apparatuses of the totalitarian 
state, panopticon surveillance focuses 
on proteing and maaining the 
national security state’s monoly of 
litical were. Police state surveillance is 
designed to facilitate the early discovery 
of opsition and decisively eliminate 
it before substantive change or reform 
occurs. In addition to eliminating litical 
opsition  the Occupy Wall Street 
movement serves as a prime exame  
the Stasi state is designed to imidate and 
moderate expressions of litical opinion. 

It can be persuasively argued that this 
is the reason the establishment media 
obsessively dwells on the NSA story and 
its associated memes. The establishment 


media consistently rtrays former NSA 
analyst Edward Snowden in a negative 
light and charaerizes him as a “leaker” of 
state secrets. This narrative and a deluge 
of revelations about the depth and severity 
of government surveillance have produced 
behavior on the part of journalists and 
others previously observed in communist 
and socialist authoritarian states. 

“The question of the harms caused by 
widespread surveillance in democracies, 
like the surveillance being condued 
by the U.S. National Security Agency, is 
under-exored,” exains PEN America, 
an organization dedicated to freedom of 
expression. A survey condued recently 
by the group and published in a paper 
titled “Chilling Effes: NSA Surveillance 
Drives U.S. Writers to Self-Censor” 
reveals that  percent of writers “are 
woed about government surveillance of 


 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 



















Americans and  percent of writers have 
never been as woed about privacy rights 
and freedom of the press as they are today.” 

According to the survey, writers and 
journalists are reluant to research and 
write about the American Stasi state 
apparatus and controversial litical topics. 
“I have felt that even to comment on the 
Snowden case in an email would flag my 
email as worthy of being looked at,” one 
resndent said. “I have made a conscious, 
deliberate choice to avoid certain 
conversation topics in eleronic emails out 
of concern that those communications may 
be surveilled,” said another. 

The current atmosphere, according to one 
resndent, is reminiscent of the repressive 
climate prevalent in the former Soviet 
Union. Certain precautions by writers today 
“remind me of my days as Moscow Bureau 
Chief of [a major news outlet] under 
Communism, when to communicate with 
dissidents and refuseniks we had to avoid 
substantive phone conversations, meet 
in person in public, etc. It’s not a good 
feeling to have rerters’ work in your own 


country’s capital resemble ours in Moscow 
in the bad old days.” 

Private conversation in the public space 
to avoid telephone eavesdropping may have 
worked in the “bad old days” of the Soviet 
Union, but surveillance technology now 
makes this nearly imssible in America, as 
Info wars has rerted. “The ability to record 
street conversations is merely one special 
feature of the Intellistreets lighting system, 
which is linked back to a central data hub 
via a ubiquitous wi-fi conneion,” writes 
Paul Joseph Watson. “The ‘smart’ street lights 
can also a as surveillance cameras, make 
loudspeaker security announcements (See 
Something, Say Something), as well as track 
“RFID equipped staff,” which could be any of 
us given the increasing amount of clothing 
and produs which are RFID tagged.” 

PEN has called on the government “to 
take immediate steps to restore public 
confidence that private communications 
remain private and proteed,” a call 
that will naturally fall on deaf ears. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman 
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, 


and other members of Congress stand 
behind the ongoing effort by the NSA to 
fully imement a Stasi state surveillance 
panopticon. 

In resnse to public outrage, Feinstein, 
the elligence committees, and 
members of Congress have put forth 
legislation designed to “pa a veneer 
of transparency over still deey secret 
programs,” rerts the Eleronic Frontier 
Foundation. Congress is busily at work 
construing what amounts to a “NSA 
entrenchment bill”  not serious reform 
of lice state surveillance. Congress is 
certainly not following its oath to defend 
and prote the Constitution. 

Inculcating fear and cowing an 
independent elligentsia is high on the 
to-do list of the national security state. 
Short of establishing an American version 
of Glavlit, the Soviet arm of administrative 
censorship imsed on the press, the 
ruling globalist elite are moving to shape 
the flow of information in part through 
imidation of journalists by creating an 
atmosphere of fear and suspicion.

School Test Teaches 
Kids “Commands of 
Government Officials 
Must Be Obeyed by All” 

Indorination Papers Produced by Global Education 
Corration as Part of “No Child Left Behind” Program 


A parent of a  year old was shocked 
to discover a grammar and writing 
test paper that their child brought 
home from school reads more like 
document from an authoritarian 
country such as China. The parent sent a rtion of 
the test paper to Infowars, revealing that it contains 
sentences such as “The commands of government 
officials must be obeyed by all.” The paper uses 
such sentences and asks school children to reace 
certain words in order to make the sentence contain 
a ssessive noun. 

Others within the paper include: 

“The job of a president is not easy.” 

“He makes sure the laws of the country are fair.” 
“The wants of an individual are less imrtant 
than the needs of a nation.” 

Un further investigation it appears that 
the paper is part of a set produced by Pearson 
Education, a global corration that provides 
education publishing and assessment services 
to schools in the U.S. and the rest of the world. 
Pearson is the world’s largest for-profit education 
business. The particular sentence about everyone 
obeying government commands appears in other 
Pearson papers, such as one of their fifth grade 
grammar tests. 

According to the company’s Wikipedia page and 
its website, Pearson owns leading educational media 
brands including Addison-Wesley, BBC Aive, Bug 
Club, eCollege, Fronter, Longman, MyEnglishLab, 
Penguin Readers, Prentice Hall, Poptropica, and 
Financial Times Press. Pearson is part of Pearson 
PLC, which also owns Penguin Books and the 
Financial Times. In , Pearson also negotiated a 
five-year, $ million contra with the New York 
State Department of Education to design tests for 


students in grades four through eight. 

Some have criticized the company’s test papers. 
Last year papers designed for NYSED were found 
to contain over  errors. Writing for The New 
York Times, Gail Collins noted, “We have turned 
school testing o a huge corrate profit center, 
led by Pearson, for whom $ million is anually 
pretty small tatoes. Pearson has a five-year 
testing contra with Texas that’s costing the state 
taxpayers nearly half of a billion dollars.” 

Collins outlines the fa that Pearson is being 
contraed under the controversial No Child Left 
Behind program set up by the government in , 
“This is the part of education reform nobody told 
you about. You heard about accountability and 
choice and innovation, but when No Child Left 
Behind was passed  years ago, do you recall 
anybody mentioning that it would provide monster 
profits for the private business seor?” Collins 
continues, “[Pearson’s] lobbyists include the guy 
who served as the top White House liaison with 
Congress on drafting the No Child Left Behind law. 
It has its own nonprofit foundation that sends state 
education commissioners on free trips overseas to 
contemate school reform.” 

Ah, all becomes clear. Government contraed 
education papers telling children that they must 
obey the commands of the government. Nice. Along 
with enforcing government mandated rules such as 
banning packed lunches, this will be seen by many 
as yet another exame of how the nanny state is 
encroaching via the public education system. It’s a 
concept also being promoted by the mass media. 
Earlier this year, MSNBC ran a segment pushing the 
notion that kids belong to the “colleive,” and that 
the “idea that kids belong to their parents or kids 
belong to their families” should be eliminated.

Keeping the Barbarians 
from Coming Together: 
Propaganda, Psy-Ops & 
COINTELPRO 


written by: Kurt Nimmo 



D uring the tumultuous Benghazi hearings, we discovered thatthe CIA had collaborated 
with the House Permanent Sele Committee on Intelligence to feed highly 
massaged talking s to the corrate media. “We had some new members on 
the committee, and we knew the press would be very aggressive on this, so we didn’t 
want any of them to make mistakes,” Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a 
Maryland Democrat, exained in May,  .  “We didn’t want to jeopardize sources 
and methods, and we didn’t want to tip off the bad guys. That’s all.” 


When Ruppersberger said the elligence 
committee was concerned about the press 
making mistakes, what he meant to say was 
the government wanted to make certain the 
media abided by the official narrative. In the 
process, he disclosed how the government 
diates news stories to a corrate media 
that normally behaves as a trustworthy 
propaganda conduit. During the feeding 
frenzy that is partisan litics in Washington, 
Republicans eager to tarnish the Obama 
administration and gain litical yardage 
revealed to the public that David H. Petraeus, 
then CIA direor, had engaged in  hours 
of ense editing of data on the Benghazi 
attack, ending to make the agency look 
good. The whitewash provided a rare glimpse 
of how the art of government propaganda 
management works. The event reformulation 
and narrative editing processes were also 
revealed during incidents such as the Boston 
bombing when the official story sustained 
numerous revisions. 

In July, John Hudson, writing for Foreign 
Policy , repeated the myth that U.S. law 
prevented the government from broadcasting 
programming to the American public.  In 
a stri sense, Hudson is corre. Unlike the 
former Soviet Union or Iran, the United 
States government does not maain an 
official media agency like Pravda or the 


Islamic Republic News Agency. Instead, 
the government controls the media in an 
unofficial and more or less covert fashion. 
Beginning in the late s, the CIA 
organized Operation Mockingbird and “began 
a systematic infiltration of the corrate 
media, a process that often included dire 
takeover of major news outlets,” writes Alex 
Constantine.  “In the s, outlays for 
global propaganda climbed to a full third 
of the CIAs covert operations budget. Some 
, salaried and contra CIA emoyees 
were eventually engaged in propaganda 
efforts. The cost of disinforming the world 
cost American taxpayers an estimated $ 
million a year by , a budget larger than 
the combined expenditures of Reuters, UPI, 
and the AP news syndicates.” 

Hudson notes a licy change instituted 
in July of  that removed restriions 
on several of the CIAs overseas propaganda 
operations, including Voice of America 
and Radio Free Europe. Exoiting the Red 
Scare and the anti-communist crusade of 
the s, the CIA established a number 
of large scale propaganda efforts aimed 
at foreign nations. “Blessed with secrecy 
and lack of congressional oversight, 

CIA operations became corrupt almost 
immediately,” writes James W. Douglass.  
“Using propaganda stations like Voice of 


America and Radio Free Europe, the CIA felt 
justified in manipulating the public for its 
own good. The broadcasts were so patently 
false that for a time it was illegal to publish 
transcripts of them in the U.S.” 

Smith-Mundt: Psychological 
Warfare Unbound 

No longer. In , an amendment inserted 
in a defense authorization bill reversed the 
current ban on “domestic dissemination” 
of propaganda material produced by the 
State Department and the independent 
Broadcasting Board of Governors. The change 
neutralized the Smith-Mundt A of  
and Foreign Relations Authorization A in 
 that had proteed Americans from 
exsure to patently false disinformation 
produced by the United States government. 
“The bill’s suprters say the informational 
material used overseas to influence foreign 
audiences is too good to not use at home, 
and that new techniques are needed to help 
fight al-Qaeda, a borderless enemy whose 
own propaganda reaches Americans online,” 
investigative journalist Michael Hastings 
wrote for BuzzFeed on May ,  .  
(Hastings died in early  under suspicious 
circumstances) . The amendment “removes 
the proteion for Americans,” a Pentagon 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


 



official told BuzzFeed. “It removes oversight 
from the people who want to put out this 
information. There are no checks and 
balances. No one knows if the information is 
accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.” 

The Pentagon has spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars since the onset of the 
War on Terror to produce “orly tracked 
marketing and propaganda campaigns that 
military leaders like to call ‘information 
operations,’ the modern equivalent of 
psychological warfare,” Tom Vanden Brook 
and Ray Locker rerted for USA Today in 
February,  .  The operation aimed at 
the American public is straight out of the 
Pentagon’s counterinsurgency manual, a 
guide to U.S. military licy in Afghanistan 
that instrus commanders to “aggressively 
use” information operations ended to 
sway local pulations and “admit mistakes 
quickly,” according to Brook and Locker. 

Brook and Locker were subsequently 


targeted by the Pentagon for rerting on 
the its illegal marketing and propaganda 
campaigns. Bogus Twitter and Facebook 
accounts were created in their names. 

The information warfare taic extended 
to Wikipedia and numerous blog entries 
and comments. Moreover, two websites, 
TomVandenBrook.com and RayLocker.com, 
were established by persons unknown. “If 
the websites were created using federal 
funds, it could violate federal law prohibiting 
the produion of propaganda for domestic 
consumption,” Gregory Korte wrote for USA 
Today on April ,  .  

In addition to emoying psychological 
operations against journalists and the 
American people, the U.S. military use 
information warfare against members of 
Congress. Under orders from Lt. General 
William Caldwell, the U.S. Army deoyed 
psy-op warfare against senators and other 
high level VIPs visiting Afghanistan. “My job 


in psy-ops is to ay with people’s heads, to 
get the enemy to behave the way we want 
them to behave,” said Lt. Colonel Michael 
Holmes, the leader of an information 
operations unit at Camp Eggers in Kabul, 
Afghanistan, according to Michael Hastings.  

In March , the American Civil Liberties 
Union cited the Hastings story in a letter sent 
to the Senate.  The ACLU mentioned the 
Smith-Mundt A of  prohibiting the use 
of government funded propaganda within 
the United States. “Though expressly direed 
at State Department programs created in 
the A, this language was erpreted by 
Congress and the DoD to apy government- 
wide, as DoD had no independent authority 
to condu ernational information 
operations,” the organization ed out. 
“Congress more direly banned propaganda 
efforts direed at U.S. audiences with 
appropriations riders,” but despite these 
prohibitions the “DoD has repeatedly 



 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 



engaged in elligence colleion aivities 
targeting U.S. persons and information 
operations targeting U.S. audiences since the 
terrorist attacks of September , .” 

The following year, however, the 
government decided to legalize the sort of 
psychological operations and propaganda 
campaigns expressly forbidden under Smith- 
Mundt, thus making the ACLU’s protest little 
more than a moot . 

Beyond Psychological Warfare: Dire 
Attacks by the State on Dissent 

Along with widespread informational and 
psychological warfare, the national security 
state also direly attacked litical groups. 
Organized government attacks against 
organized litical opsition has a long 
and dated history, beginning soon after the 
founding of the republic, specifically with 
the passage of the Alien and Sedition As in 
 by the Federalists. It has gained critical 
momentum in the modern era. 

During the First World War, the 
government created the Bureau of 
Investigation, predecessor to the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, and aped 
J. Edgar Hoover as its head. Hoover’s 
Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance 
of lice and the military  described 
as a “citizens auxiliary”  condued 
dire aion mass raids against the anti- 
war movement of the time, according 
to documents released by the Church 
Committee in the s. The Bureau, 
specifically designed as a national litical 
lice force, “rounded up some , men 
without warrants of sufficient probable 
cause for arrest” for the crime of opsing 
the First World War.  

In , Attorney General A. Mitchell 
Palmer condued a massive program in 
 cities rounding up over , people. 
The Church Committee Rert cites “the 
abuses of due process of law incident to the 
raids.”  According to Robert Preston, Jr., 
the Palmer Raids involved “indiscriminate 
arrests of the innocent with the guilty, 
unlawful seizures by federal deteives” and 
other violations of constitutional rights.  
The Church Committee “found federal agents 
guilty of using third-degree tortures, making 
illegal searches and arrests, and using agents 
provocateurs.” Palmer and Hoover found no 
evidence of a prosed Bolshevik revolution 


as claimed. Despite this, a large number of 
the rounded up suspes continued to be 
held without trial. 

The Second World War brought a new and 
frightening wave of government terrorism 
against litical opnents. President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt in  issued a 
memorandum giving the FBI the were to 
use warrantless wiretaps against suspeed 
subversives, that is to say aivists opsed 
to U.S. involvement in the war. FDR not only 
unleashed the FBI on aivists, but concerned 
citizens as well. After delivering a speech on 
national defense in , FDR had his press 
secretary, Stephen Early, send Hoover the 
names of  people who had sent telegrams 
to the White House criticizing the address. 
“The President thought you might like to 
look them over,” Early told Hoover.  

Following the Second World War, the 
government engineered the immensely 
profitable (for the military-industrial 
comex) Cold War and Red Scare. In , 
the FBI established COINTELPRO, short for 
Counter Intelligence Program. COINTELPRO 
was ostensibly contrived to counter 
communist subversion, but as numerous 
documents reveal, the program focused 
almost exclusively on domestic opsition to 
government licies. 

The Church Committee noted that 
COINTELPRO “had no conceivable rational 
relationship to either national security or 
violent aivity. The unexpressed major 
premise of much of COINTELPRO is that the 
Bureau has a role in maaining the existing 
social order, and that its efforts should be 
aimed toward combating those who threaten 
that order.”  “This is a rough, tough, dirty 
business, and dangerous,” former Assistant to 
Direor Hoover, William C. Sullivan, told the 
Church Committee.  “No holds were barred.” 

This “rough, tough, dirty business” included 
infiltration of litical groups, psychological 
warfare, legal harassment, and extralegal 
force and violence. “The FBI and lice 
threatened, instigated, and condued break- 
ins, vandalism, assaults, and beatings. The 
obje was to frighten dissidents and disrupt 
their movements,” write Mike Cassidy and 
Will Miller.  “They used secret and systematic 
methods of fraud and force, far beyond mere 
surveillance, to sabotage constitutionally 
proteed litical aivity. The purse of the 
program was, in FBI Direor J. Edgar Hoover’s 
own words, to ‘exse, disrupt, misdire,

discredit, and otherwise neutralize’ specific 
groups and individuals.” 

After the Church Committee exsed 
COINTELPRO, the government claimed it had 
dismantled the program. However, in the s, 
the Reagan administration legalized the taics 
by signing Executive Order . “There is 
every reason to believe that even what was 
not legalized is still going on as well. Lest we 
forget, Lt. Colonel Oliver North funded and 
orchestrated from the White House basement 
break-ins and other ‘dirty tricks’ to defeat 
congressional critics of U.S. licy in Central 
America and to neutralize grassroots protest. 
Special Prosecutor Walsh found evidence that 
North and Richard Secord (archite of the 
s covert aions in Cambodia) used Iran- 
Contra funds to harass the Christie Institute, a 
church-funded public erest group specializing 
in exsing government miscondu,” Cassidy 
and Miller continue. 

In addition, North worked with FEMA to 
develop contingency ans for suspending the 
Constitution, establishing martial law, and 
holding litical dissidents in concentration 
camps. Following the false flag attacks of 
September , , the government has 
worked tirelessly to fine tune ans designed 
to imse martial law. It has also worked to 
federalize and militarize law enforcement 
around the country. 

Brian Glick argues that COINTELPRO is a 
permanent feature of the national security 
state. “The record of the past  years 
reveals a pattern of continuous domestic 
covert aion,” Glick wrote in the s.  
“Its use has been documented in each of 
the last nine administrations, Democratic 
as well as Republican. FBI testimony shows 
‘COINTELPRO taics’ already in full swing 
during the presidencies of Democrats Franklin 


Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman. 
COINTELPRO itself, while initiated under 
Eisenhowere, grew from one program to six 
under the Democratic administrations of 
Kennedy and Johnson . . . After COINTELPRO 
was exsed [by the Church Committee] , 
similar programs continued under other 
names during the Carter years, as well as 
under Nixon, Ford, and Reagan. They have 
outlived J. Edgar Hoover and remained in 
ace under all of his successors.” 

Cass Sunstein: “Conspiracy Theories” 

Cass Sunstein’s white paper, “Conspiracy 
Theories,” serves as an exclamation  
in the latest chapter of a long history of 
government tyranny against citizens who 
organize in opsition to the government 
and its licies.  Sunstein argues that 
individuals and groups deviating from the 
official government narrative on a number of 
litical issues are a national security threat. 
Sunstein, who would become administrator 
of the White House Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, formulates “a an for the 
government to infiltrate conspiracy groups 
in order to undermine them via stings 
on chat rooms and social networks, as well 
as real meetings, according to a recently 
uncovered article Sunstein wrote for the 
Journal of Political Philosophy,” writes Paul 
Joseph Watson.  

Sunstein’s call for authoritarian aion 
against government critics  including 
outright censorship in addition to the 
established taics mentioned above  
reveals that COINTELPRO has indeed outlived 
Hoover. “Some conspiracy theories create 
serious risks. They do not merely undermine 
democratic debate; in extreme cases, they 


create or fuel violence,” writes Sunstein. 

“Even if only a small fraion of adherents to 
a particular conspiracy theory a on the basis 
of their beliefs, that small fraion may be 
enough to cause serious harms.” 

Sunstein’s analysis dovetails with that 
of the Department of Homeland Security. 

In its now infamous rert on “rightwing 
extremism,” the DHS insists members of the 
constitutionalist movement  including 
Libertarians and advocates of the Second 
Amendment  are not only violent, but also 
virulent racists, a conclusion provided pre- 
packaged by the Anti-Defamation League and 
the Southern Poverty Law Center. 

If realized, Cass Sunstein’s call for outright 
censorship and the absurd prosal to imse 
fines and taxes on people who hold litical 
views contrary to those of the established 
litical order will naturally result in a 
redoubling of litical aivity on the part of 
the truth movement, a growing movement 
specifically mentioned as attraing “kooks” 
according to Sunstein. When faced with a 
strong and determined litical opsition, 
government invariably turns to more extreme 
methods to enforce its will. History repeatedly 
demonstrates that when propaganda and 
psychological operations are no longer 
effeive, the state invariably turns to more 
brutal and illegal methods of dissuading 
litical opsition to its rule.

Gay Aivist Calls for 
Mandatory Abortion 

“There’s Too Many Peoe on the Planet!” 


written by: Paul Joseph Watson 




D uring an appearance on an 
Australian television show, a 
prominent gay aivist called for 
abortion to be made mandatory 
for  years in order to reduce 
global pulation. Author and media pundit 
Dan Savage was asked by an audience 
member, “Which so-called dangerous idea 
do you each think would have the greatest 
tential to change the world for the better if 


it were imemented?” 

“Population control. There’s too many 
god***n people on the anet!” resnded 
Savage as the audience apauded. “You 
know, I’m pro-choice. I believe that women 
should have the right to control their bodies. 
Sometimes in my darker moments I’m anti- 
choice.” He continued, “I think abortion 
should be mandatory for about  years. 
That’s a dangerous idea. She wanted a 


dangerous idea. So throw a chair at me.” 
Savage’s previous exoits include vowing 
to inseminate his husband for God, wishing 
that “the Republicans were all f***ing dead,” 
and expressing the desire that a litical 
candidate “should be dragged behind a 
pickup truck until there’s nothing left but the 
rope.” Savage’s favored licy of mandatory 
abortion is already in ace in Communist 
China, where women who flout the country’s

infamous one child licy and cannot pay 
huge fines are kidnapped off the street by 
government goons, beaten up, dragged off 
to state hospitals, and subjeed to hofic 
forced abortions. 

A recent case which attraed media 
attention involved a woman who had her 
home raided in the middle of the night by 
government officials before she was abdued, 
taken to a hospital, and forcibly injeed with 
an abortion-inducing drug, terminating her 
baby which was just three months from being 
born. Babies are even forcibly aborted at nine 
months old, dying in the arms of their mother, 
while others are thrown in buckets while they 
are still alive. Aivists who speak out against 
forced abortion in China are also persecuted 
by the government. 

News network CNN, in addition to 
billionaire Ted Turner and other elitists, 
along with a whole host of pressure groups 
committed to pushing for pulation 
control, have all advocated the one child 
licy. In his  book Ecoscience, current 
senior White House science advisor John P. 
Holdren floated the idea of forced abortions 
and compulsory sterilization, amongst a 
raft of other draconian pulation control 
measures, all of which would be caed out 
by a “Planetary Regime.” 

During a  speech at Sichuan University, 
Vice President Joe Biden told an audience 
that he “fully understands” China’s one child 
licy. Aside from Savage’s call for draconian 
licies of forced abortion, the supsed 
threat sed by overpulation itself is a 
myth. The U.N.’s own figures clearly indicate 
that pulation is set to stabilize in  and 
then drop dramatically after . 

As The Economist rerted, “Fertility is 
falling and families are shrinking in aces 
 such as Brazil, Indonesia, and even parts 
of India  that people think of as teeming 
with children. As our briefing shows, the 
fertility rate of half the world is now . or 


less  the magic number that is consistent 
with a stable pulation and is usually called 
‘the reacement rate of fertility.’ Sometime 
between  and  the world’s fertility 
rate will fall below the global reacement 
rate.” Warnings about the threat sed by 
overpulation are fundamentally flawed. In 
reality, underpulation will be seen as the 
biggest danger to human prosperity in the 
latter half of the st century. 

As Slate’s Jeff Wise documents, due to 
falling fertility rates, the pulation of 
Western Europe is set to shrink from  
million to just  million by the end of 
the century. Meanwhile, Russia and China 
could lose half their pulation. Germany’s 
birthrate has sunk to to just ., with 
Italy’s at . and Spain at ., thanks to a 
natural phenomenon called “demographic 
transition,” which is the shift from high 
death rates and high birthrates to low death 
rates and low birthrates. 

Human pulation is expeed to peak at 
 billion from  to , and then it will 
start its decline. “In the long term  on the 
order of centuries  we could be looking 
at the literal extinion of humanity,” writes 
Wise, ing to a  International 
Institute for Apied Systems Analysis 
rert. Not only is Dan Savage’s call for 
mandatory abortion cometely offensive 
and an insult to women in China and other 
countries who have been subjeed to the 
horror of forced abortion, it’s justification 
to reduce global pulation is fanually and 
scientifically bankrupt.

“Gunshot Deteors” in Classrooms Surpass Big Brother in

H Kit Daniels 


I n a stinging similarity to the telescreens 
of  , schoolchildren will soon 
be monitored in real-time through 
surveillance sensors mounted inside 
the classrooms of a charter school in 
Oakland, California. SST, Inc., a Bay Area 
technology firm, is currently installing its 
ShotStter “gunshot deteor” system inside 
the school, which will allow the company’s 
emoyees to observe the classrooms through 
multie computer screens, according to the 
San Francisco Gate.

,” SST CEO Ralph Clark told the San 
Jose Mercury News. “They’re thinking about 
running for cover, hiding themselves . . . The 
people who aren’t direly in harm’s way really 
don’t know whether it’s a gunshot or not.” Yet 
as we rerted back in August, these “gunshot 
deteors” are fully capable of recording 
conversations and are rertedly better at 
doing so than anually deteing gunshots. 

One such deteor recorded a street 
argument in New Bedford, Massachusetts, 
which was later conneed to a criminal 
trial and the local distri attorney, Sam 
Sutter, thought the warrantless recording 
would be admissible in court. “In my 
view legally,” Sutter said to The New York 
Times, “what is said and picked up by the 
ShotStter recording does not have the 
expeation of privacy because it’s said out 
in public, and so I think that will turn out 
to be admissible evidence.” 

When it comes to their stated task 
of deteing gunshots, however, these 
surveillance systems have trouble identifying 
them from other loud noises, according to the 
ACLU. So far, these “gunshot deteors” have 
been predominately used outdoors, namely 
on top of street lights and buildings. Yet SST 


is now pushing to have its deteors installed 
inside airrts, malls, and additional schools 
across America in what will likely result as the 
next exosive phase of domestic surveillance. 

“Expanding the use of ShotStter 
technology to include school campuses could 
carry the cost of jeopardizing ... our privacy 
rights,” Jory Steele, managing attorney 
for the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Northern California, told the San Jose Mercury 
News. Washington, D.C. in particular is 
already blanketed with at least  “gunshot 
deteors” across  square miles of the city, 
which can easily triangulate and analyze 
audio. Illumination Concepts, the company 
resnsible for these Intellistreet Lights, 
bragged about the “Homeland Security” 
apications of its produs, including “voice 
stress analyzers” which can uoad recorded 
conversations to a central data hub. 

Other sophisticated spy technologies 
are also being used across America. The 
Las Vegas Public Works Department is 
currently installing street lights in the city 
that can record conversations in both audio 
and video, as rerted by Mikael Thalen 
of Storyleak.com. In Seattle, white boxes 
attached to utility les can effeively track 
the city’s entire pulation by recording the 
last , known GPS locations of all cell 
phones within the city, even if they are not 
conneed to a wi-fi network. 

On November , we revealed leaked 
documents showing how the public’s 
personal information harvested by the white 
boxes are being funneled o a massive 
elligence database for perpetuity. It 
is now clear that   was accurate in 
prediing the rise of the domestic spy grid, 
but not its tremendous extent as the gradual 
extinion of privacy forges ahead. 


SST IS NOW PUSHING TO HAVE 
ITS DETECTORS INSTALLED 
INSIDE AIRPORTS, MALLS, 

AND ADDITIONAL SCHOOLS

DHS Stealth Spy Grid 
Blankets Seattle 

Government Documents Obtained Exclusively by Infowars Exse Massive 
DHS Domestic Spy Grid Designed to Track Citizens in Real-Time Through 
Mega Government Databases. 


written by: 

Anthony Gucciardi, Mikael Thalen & Paul Joseph Watson 



WHEN THESE TECHNOLOGIES 
ARE COMBINED WITH THE 
FACT THAT VIRTOALLY EVERY 
NEW CONSUMER ITEM CAN 
BE LINKED TO THE INTERNET 
(AND THEREFORE TRACKED 
AND WIRETAPPED), THIS 
REPRESENTS A SURVEILLANCE 
GRID THAT MAKES NSA 
WIRETAPPING OF PHONE CALLS 
AND EMAILS LOOK ANTIQUATED 
IN COMPARISON. 


S trange new off-white boxes 

pping up in downtown Seat- 
tle use wi-fi networks that can 
record the last , locations 
of a person using their cell- 
phone’s MAC address, but the Department 
of Homeland Security  which funded the 
network to the tune of $. million dollars 
 has refused to address the nightmare 
privacy imications of a system that could 
lead to the permanent tracking of an entire 
city’s pulation. 

Labeled by their erseion location such 
as “st & University” and “nd & Seneca,” the 
multie network devices are easily deteed 
in Seattle’s downtown area through a sime 
Wi-Fi enabled device, leading many residents 
to wonder if they are being deteed in return. 
According to rerts from Kiro  News, the 
mesh network devices can capture a mobile 
user’s IP address, mobile device type, apps 
used, current location, and even historical 
location down to the last , aces visited. 

“How accurately can it geo-locate and track 
the movements of your phone, laptop, or any 
other wireless device by its MAC address? 

Can the network send that information to a 
database, allowing the SPD to reconstru 
who was where at any given time, on any 
given day, without a warrant? Can the 
network see you now?” asked weekly Seattle 
newspaper The Stranger. 

A rert by The Stranger exses how the 
boxes, which are attached to utility les and 
include vertical antennae, can track cell- 
phones even if they are not conneed to the 
system’s wi-fi network. When rerters Matt 
Fikse-Verkerk and Brendan Kiley asked the Se- 
attle Police Department and the Department 
of Homeland Security to exain what the 
boxes were for, the DHS refused to comment 


and Seattle Police deteive Monty Moss 
would only state that the department “is not 
comfortable answereing licy questions when 
we do not yet have a licy.” 

Deteive Moss added that the mesh net- 
work would not be used for “surveillance 
purses . . . without City Council’s approval 
and the appropriate court authorization.” 
Note that he didn’t say the mesh network 
couldn’t be used for the surveillance func- 
tions we asked about, only that it wouldn’t 
 at least until certain people in were say 
it can. That’s the equivalent of a “trust us” 
and a handshake. 

When these technologies are combined with 
the fa that virtually every new consumer 
item can be linked to the ernet (and there- 
fore tracked and wiretapped), this represents 
a surveillance grid that makes NSA wiretap- 
ping of phone calls and emails look antiquat- 
ed in comparison. 

The justification for the mesh network is 
that it will allow lice, firefighters, and other 
first resnders to communicate, as well as 
stream surveillance video on a private, unclut- 
tered network during an emergency. However, 
the system is, “adept at seeing all the devices 
that move through their coverage area and 
visually mapping the locations of those devic- 
es in real time for the system administrators’ 
convenience.” The SPD has also indicated that 
it ans “citywide deoyment” of the net- 
work, opening the door for mass unfettered 
surveillance of Seattle’s , residents. 

Seattle council member Bruce Harrell 
justified the mesh network being used for 
surveillance purses by making reference to 
the Boston bombings. “While I understand 
that a lot of people have concerns about the 
government having access to this information, 
when we have large public gatherings like the 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


 



situation like in Boston and something bad 
happens, the first thing we want to know is 
how are we using technology to capture that 
information,” Harrell told KIRO-TV. 

“We are being told that such measures will 
help lice ‘solve more crime.’ We are being 
told that such measures will ‘keep people 
safe.’ But what about our privacy? Doesn’t 
that count for something? What about the 
Fourth Amendment? Are our most cherished 
liberties and freedoms going to be thrown 
o the trash just because we live ‘in a more 
dangerous world?”’ asks Michael Snyder. 

But as exclusive documents obtained by 
Infowars from an insider government source 
reveal, the $. million DHS -funded grid is 
far deeper than the media is telling you. The 
Seattle DHS spy system ultimately ties in with 
an enormous stealth database that as as an 
elligence hub for all of your personal data. 

On page  of the “Port Security Video 
Surveillance System with Wireless Mesh 


Network” proje document that we have 
obtained, a diagram reveals the system’s 
basic communication abilities in regards to 
the Port of Seattle that the DHS has refused 
to comment on despite funding with millions 
in taxpayer dollars. So far Seattle lice have 
been tight-lipped about the network’s roll-out. 
Several groups including the ACLU have sub- 
mitted requests to learn the programs end- 
ed use, but days have turned to months as the 
mesh network continues its advancement. 

Despite a recently passed ordinance requir- 
ing all tential surveillance equipment to be 
given city council approval and public review 
within  days of its imementation, the 
network has remained shrouded in secrecy. 
Unknown to the public until now, informa- 
tion regarding the system has been hiding in 
ain view since last February at minimum. 
Diagrams attached to a March  prosal 
request (# DIT-), which have since been 
approved, updated, and finalized, are publicly 


viewable at the Seattle.gov website. 

Several conneions can be made by study- 
ing the diagram, including its now apparent 
link to Seattle’s public waterfront. The recent 
instillation of  Department of Homeland 
Security-funded surveillance cameras on Seat- 
tle’s pular waterfront, comete with mesh 
network devices attached, were purrted 
to increase the Port of Seattle’s proteion 
against such as as terrorism. Residents soon 
discovered multie cameras facing inward 
toward Seattle homes, not towards the coast 
line as allegedly ended. The “accident” was 
later remedied by city officials. 

While unknown members of multie law 
enforcement agencies will have access to 
the mesh network, so will the Seattle Fusion 
Center, where FBI and Homeland Security 
gather data on Americans deemed “extremist” 
for such crimes as “loving liberty.” Incredibly, 
even the U.S. Senate called the Fusion Centers 
a “useless and costly effort that trames on 



It began earlier than you might think. Technology giant IBM roduced voice recognition to the world in  on “World News To- 
night” with Peter Jennings. An experimental computer system was unveiled in a short video narrated by a woman showcasing the vast 
capabilities of a computer system that we would be inclined to dismiss as primitive next to today’s processing capabilities. The mono- 
chromatic disay renders her speech with an accuracy that seems to surpass Ape’s famous Siri apication. If this could be the 
nearly unthinkable software capabilities publicly flaunted by the technocracy close to  years ago, it does not take much to imagine 
what is available to the greedy globalist elites and were-mad liticians today. The frightening reality is that what we know about 
the extent of the reach of corrate erests and the military-industrial comex o our private lives is just the tip of the iceberg.

civil liberties” in a  bi-partisan rert. 

Page  of the public document details 
the information-colleing capabilities of the 
Network Mesh System (NMS), revealing its 
ability to colle identifying data of anyone 
“accessing the network.” Although the doc- 
ument details an alert system for rerting 
unauthorized access, California-based Aruba 
Networks  a major provider of next- gen- 
eration mobile network access solutions and 
the company that provided the boxes to the 
Seattle Police Department  brags in its tech- 
nical literature about how the boxes can keep 
track of “rogue” or “unassociated” devices, in 
other words your cellphone even if you have 
refused to let the system access your device’s 
wi-fi comnent. 

The user’s guide for one of Aruba’s re- 
cent software produs states, “The wireless 
network has a wealth of information about 
unassociated and associated devices.” That 
software includes “a location engine that 
calculates associated and unassociated device 
location every  seconds by default . . . The 
last , historical locations are stored for 
each MAC address.” 

“The NMS also colles information about 
every Wi Fi client accessing the network, 
including its MAC address, IP address, signal 
ensity, data rate and traffic status,” the Port 
Security document reads. “Additional NMS 
features include a fault management system 
for issuing alarms and logging events accord- 
ing to a set of customizable filtering rules, 
along with centralized and version-controlled 
remote updating of the Aruba Mesh Operating 
System software.” 

The diagram shows what also may be the 
Seattle Department of Transrtation Intelli- 
gent Transrtation Systems Network, linked 
direly o the mesh network. According to 
the Department of Transrtation website, the 
system controls several surveillance related 
items such as license ate readers and closed 
circuit TV (CCTV) systems. 


An early draft of the diagram appears to 
show Seattle lice vehicle’s ability to receive 
and “control” certain aspes of the mesh 
network. Whether lice were originally 
ended to control surveillance cameras 
from their vehicles, including their panning, 
tilting, and zooming abilities, remains unclear. 
According to statements made by Seattle’s 
Assistant Chief Paul McDonagh last February 
regarding the waterfront cameras specifically, 
“only a few people would have that capability, 
so the officer on the street would just have the 
ability to view it.” 

Following a privacy outcry concerning 
the wi-fi “mesh network,” the Seattle Police 
Department resnded to the controversy by 
announcing that it will temrarily deaivate 
the network, which was rushed through the 
Seattle City Council with virtually no over- 
sight, and allow public scrutiny of the system 
before proceeding. 

“The wireless mesh network will be deai- 
vated until city council approves a draft licy 
and until there’s an oprtunity for vigorous 
public debate,” SPD skesperson Sgt. Sean 
Whitcomb said, adding that turning off the 
system involves, “a little more than just flip- 
ping a switch.” 

“Our sition is that the technology is the 
technology,” Whitcomb added, “but we want 
to make sure that we have safeguards and 
licies in ace so people with legitimate 
privacy concerns aren’t woed about how 
it’s being used.” Whitcomb dubiously asserted 
that the network was “operational without be- 
ing operated” because lice had switched on 
the network for DHS grant-mandated testing 
and then forgot to turn it off again. 

Police Chief Jim Pugel gave the order to 
begin the deaivation on November , but 
a temrary hold on the system is unlikely to 
satisfy surveillance critics. Most privacy advo- 
cates will not be satisfied until the wi-fi mesh 
network which currently covers downtown 
Seattle is ripped out cometely and aban- 


doned for good. At the very least, clear and 
provable safeguards need to be put in ace to 
ensure that devices which are not conneed 
to the network cannot be tracked. 

Despite claims by the Seattle Police De- 
partment, as of Wednesday, November , at 
pm, the network was still very much aive. 
While no one expes the SPD to remove all 
the boxes within  hours, authorities did 
promise to switch off the network. That clear- 
ly hasn’t happened since the wi-fi hubs were 
still broadcasting a signal, giving them the 
capability to track the location of every cell- 
phone in the vicinity even if it is not conne- 
ed to the network. A Reddit user commented 
that, “The devices remain broadcasting all 
over downtown.” 

While the Seattle Police Department’s failure 
to deaivate the network is likely due to tar- 
diness and not outright deception, it doesn’t 
do a great deal to suggest that authorities are 
that eager to allay the concerns of privacy 
advocates. Combined with the fa that the in- 
cident with the SPD surveillance cameras was 
exained as an “accident” by officials is not 
going to provide much assurance that Seattle 
authorities have much concern for privacy. 

In reality, Seattle is only one of countless 
cities across the country being flooded with a 
sea of surveillance equipment. While the pub- 
lic has focused mainly on surveillance issues 
relating to the NSA, the federal government 
has continued its -us year dragnet surveil- 
lance grid roll out of covert conversation-re- 
cording microphones. 

Despite the federal government’s constant 
justification of throwing away civil liberties in 
the name of fighting terrorism, which kills less 
Americans than bee stings, continued NSA 
revelations show that the federal govern- 
ment’s continued surveillance system build-up 
is aimed at everyday Americans, not foreign 
al-Qaeda admittedly suprted by the U.S. 
government in Syria.

Feds Deoy National Spy 
System of Microphones 

Hidden in Plain Sight: The Next Level of NSA Snooping Will 
Dete Dissent Via Ubiquitous Audio Sensors 


written by: 

Paul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones 


The revelations of Edward Snowden shined fresh light on 
NSA spying targeting the American people, but what has 
gone largely unnoticed is the fa that a network of differ- 
ent spy systems which can record real-time conversations 
are already in ace throughout many urban areas of the 
United States, as well as in the technology produs we 
buy and use on a regular basis. 


These systems are no secret  they are hid- 
ing in ain view  and yet concerns about 
the monolithic tential for their abuse have 
been muted. That lack of discussion rep- 
resents a massive lost oprtunity for the pri- 
vacy community because, whereas lls have 
shown apathy indifference, or even suprt 
for NSA spying, aneotal evidence suggests 
that people would be up in arms if they knew 
the content of their daily conversations were 
under surveillance. 

The dystopian movie V for Vendetta features 
a scene in which goons working for the to- 
talitarian government drive down residential 
streets with spy technology listening to peo- 
e’s conversations to dete the vehemence 
of criticism against the state. Such technology 
already exists or is rapidly being roduced 
through a number of different guises in Amer- 
ica and numerous other developed countries. 

The Washington Post recently published a 
feature length article on gunshot deteors, 
known as ShotStter, which detailed how 


in Washington, D.C., there are now, “at least 
 acoustic sensors across  square miles 
of the city.” The microphones are wrapped 
in a weather-proof shell that can dete the 
location of a sound down to a few yards and 
analyze the audio using a computer program. 

While the systems are touted as “gunshot 
deteors,” as The New York Times rerted 
in May , similar technology is already 
installed in over  cities around the country, 
and in some cases it is being used to listen to 
conversations. “In at least one city, New Bed- 
ford, Massachusetts, where sensors recorded 
a loud street argument that accompanied a 
fatal shooting in December, the system has 
raised questions about privacy and the reach 
of lice surveillance, even in the service of 
reducing gun violence,” states the rert. 

Frank Camera, the lawyer for Jonathan 
Flores, a man charged with murder, com- 
ained that the technology is “opening up 
a whole can of worms.” “If the lice are 
utilizing these conversations, then the issue 


is, where does it stop?” he asked. This led the 
ACLU to warn that the technology could rep- 
resent a clear violation of the Fourth Amend- 
ment if misused. 

The ACLU’s Jay Stanley asked, “whether mi- 
crophones can be remotely aivated by lice 
who want to listen to nearby conversations,” 
noting that it was illegal for lice “to make 
audio recordings of conversations in which 
they are not a participant without a warrant 
... If the courts start allowing recordings of 
conversations picked up by these devices to 
be admitted as evidence, then it will provide 
an additional incentive to the lice to install 
microphones in our public spaces, over and 
above what is justified by the level of effec- 
tiveness the technology proves to have in 
pining gun shots,” wrote Stanley. 

Eventually, if indeed it is not already hap- 
pening in some major metrolitan areas, 
voices will be linked to biometric facial 
profiles via the Trapwire system, which allows 
the government to monitor citizens via public

and private CCTV networks. Numerous major 
cities in the Unites States are currently being 
fitted with Intellistreets ‘smart’ street light- 
ing systems that also have the capability of 
recording conversations and sending them 
direly to authorities via wi-fi. The Las Vegas 
Public Works Department has begun testing 
the devices, which a as surveillance cam- 
eras, Minority Rert-style advertising hubs, 
and Homeland Security alert systems. As ABC 
 rerted in , they are “also capable of 
recording conversations.” 

We first rerted on Intellistreets bragging 
of its produ’s “homeland security” apica- 
tions back in , with the backlash from 
privacy advocates causing the company to 


remove a promotional video from YouTube. 
The video was later restored, although com- 
ments were disabled. However, Illuminating 
Concepts, the company behind Intellistreets, 
seems to be more comfortable in acknowl- 
edging the “security” aspes of its devices 
now that it has secured numerous lucrative 
government contras to supy street lighting 
in several major cities. 

A page on the Intellistreets website that 
highlights “benefits and apications” features 
a seion on security, wherein it is admitted 
that the hi-tech system includes “voice stress 
analyzers,” amongst several other sophisticat- 
ed sensors that “assist DHS in proteing its 
citizens and natural resources.” 


THE LAS VEGAS PUBUC 
WORKS DEPARTMENT 
HAS BEGUN TESTING THE 
DEVICES, WHICH ACT AS 
SURVEILLANCE cameras, 
MINORITY REPORT-STYLE 
ADVERTIS NG HUBS, AND 
HOMELAND SECORTtY 
ALEKTSYSTEMS. 


«< INFOWARS.COM > 


 



The ability to record street conversations is 
merely one special feature of the Intellistreets 
lighting system, which is linked back to a cen- 
tral data hub via a ubiquitous wi-fi connec- 
tion. The “smart” street lights can also a as 
surveillance cameras and make loudspeaker 
security announcements (See Something, Say 
Something), as well as track “RFID equipped 
staff,” which could be any of us given the 
increasing amount of clothing and produs 
which are RFID tagged. 

The company’s website highlights how 
the system is now being installed in areas 
of Las Vegas, Chicago, Detroit, Auburn 
Hills, Asbury Park, and at stadiums like the 
Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans. 
The Las Vegas Public Works Department has 
begun testing the devices although they de- 
nied they would be used for surveillance, at 
least for the time being. Authorities in New 
York City also recently announced that they 
would be reacing the city’s , street 
lights with new LEDs by , although it is 
not known how many of these if any will be 
provided by Intellistreets. 

Intellistreets is just one comnent of a 
huge network of microphones embedded in 
everything from games consoles to gunshot 
deteors that are beginning to blanket our 
streets and dominate our home life. The next 
level of NS A snooping will rely on systems 
like these to record people’s conversations 
and dete antagonism or litical extremism 
and represents the tential for a ubiquitous 
wiretapping system that outstrips George 
Orwell’s worst nightmare. 

Televisions, computers and cellphones are 


already utilizing technology that records 
conversations in order to bombard users with 
invasive targeted advertising. Last year, Verizon 
followed Google’s lead and officially filed a 
patent for a set-top box that will aively spy 
on Americans in their own homes by turning 
TVs o wiretaps. The patent apication says 
that the technology will be capable of deteing 
“ambient aion” including “cuddling, fighting, 
and talking” in people’s living rooms. The box 
will even listen to your conversations, accord- 
ing to the communication giant’s patent. 

“If deteion facility detes one or more 
words sken by a user (e.g., while talking 
to another user within the same room or 
on the telephone), advertising facility may 
utilize the one or more words sken by the 
user to search for and/or sele an adver- 
tisement associated with the one or more 
words,” the document states. In an article 
published by Infowars in , we highlight- 
ed the fa that, “Digital cable TV boxes, such 
as Scientific Atlanta, have had secret in-built 
microphones inside them since their incep- 
tion in the late s.” 

This technology is now commonace, 
with produs like the Xbox utilizing built-in 
microphones to allow voice control. Microsoft 
promises that it won’t use the microphones 
to record your conversations, which is a fairly 
hollow guarantee given that Microsoft col- 
laborated with the NSA to allow the federal 
agency to bypass its encryption services in 
order to spy on people. App providers on the 
Android network also now require users to 
agree to a condition that, “Allows the app 
to record audio with the microphone,” on 


cellphones and other “smart” devices. “This 
permission allows the app to record audio at 
any time without your confirmation,” states the 
text of the agreement. 

Virtually every new technological device 
now being manufaured that is linked to the 
Internet has the capability to record conversa- 
tions and send them back to a central hub. Is 
it really any wonder therefore that former CIA 
direor David Petraeus heralded the aval of 
the “smart home” as a boon for “clandestine 
statecraft?” 

Whistlebloweres such as William Binney have 
warned that the NSA has virtually every U.S. 
citizen under surveillance, with the ability to 
record all of their communications. The agency 
recently cometed construion of a monolith- 
ic heavily fortified $ billion facility deep in the 
Utah desert to process and analyze all of the 
information colleed. 

If the revelations of Edward Snowden taught 
us one thing then it is that if the NSA has the 
capability to use a technology to spy on its 
primary target  the American people  then 
it is already doing so. The state already has al- 
ready had blanket access to phone records since 
at least  through the Hemisphere program, 
under which AT&T gave the Drug Enforcement 
Agency access to call logs. 

This network of computer programs, urban 
wi-fi infrastruure, and technological produs 
inside our homes that all have the capability of 
recording our conversations represents an even 
more invasive and Orwellian prospe than 
anything Edward Snowden brought to light, 
and yet discussion of its threat to fundamental 
privacy has been virtually non-existent.
