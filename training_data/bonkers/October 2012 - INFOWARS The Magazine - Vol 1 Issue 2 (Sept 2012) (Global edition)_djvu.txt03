BY JAMIE BALAGIA - THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY BETTER KNOWN AS THE DUDE 


 DEFINITELY 
MATCHING U ALL 


T he Fourth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution guarantees our right to privacy. It 
reads, in part, that we have the right to be “secure 
in [our] persons, houses, papers, and effes, 
against unreasonable searches and seizures Courts have 
long said that this provision is a guarantee to a right to 
privacy from government rusion in our daily lives. 
Unfortunately, that guarantee is in serious jeopardy and 
at risk of becoming meaningless words on an outdated 
document. Are you willing to silently let that happen? 

When courts look at whether the government has the 
right to snoop o our lives, they evaluate the rusion 
by first looking at whether we have a “reasonable expec- 
tation of privacy” in the area where the government is 
looking. The U.S. Supreme Court said in Katz v. United 
States that, “what [a private citizen] seeks to preserve as 
private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be 
constitutionally proteed.” But, held that we are not free 
from the government’s prying eyes when we knowingly 
exse our words or aions to the public. The basic rule 
is that if the public can see what you are doing, so can 
“the State.” The government, by court dorine, is free 
to do the same as any ordinary citizen  watch what you 
do in the open and take aion based on what they see. 
But, with the advent of new technologies, what 


is “open” is increasingly uncertain. As a kid, I was 
awestruck watching the eavesdropping abilities of 
aliens in science fiion movies and on television. The 
snooping techniques from those shows have now been 
eclipsed by the research and developments of today, 
and most of these developments are made by the mil- 
itary and defense firms that supy their goods to the 
government not to the people. 

The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have brought us drone 
and computer monitoring capabilities unthinkable when 
these “open air” court dorines were first announced. 
Today’s drones are capable of taking piures from thou- 
sands of feet in the air with such clarity that you can iden- 
tify the brand of cigarettes in a person’s hand. Combine 
that with the FBI’s advanced facial recognition software 
called Next Generation Identification, and you have the 
makings of a scary future. 

To understand how all of these systems and pro- 
grams work it is imrtant to define a “mashup.” A 
mashup is simy the rapid combining of data from 
multie sources o a single file or presentation doc- 
ument of some kind. Essentially, a mashup pulls all the 
information it can from whatever source ssible and 
tries to make sense of it all. In February , the FBI
