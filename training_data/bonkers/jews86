people by anyone. But we have the right to insist that our leaders be Christian in its Biblical concept. It is 
honorable for Christian men and women to determine the destiny of a Christian nation. It should not be 
determined by some heathen cult who hates the very founder of Christianity and all it stands for. We 
have no business putting aliens like (ZIONIST) Henry Kissinger and Zignew Brezinski o sitions of 
were in our government and we should have learned by now, that this will bring us nothing but extreme 
grief. Any fool should know that a Jew in a ace of litical were will not vote for the good of a 
Christian. 

Should we be required to surrender to the anti-Christ's who would remove the name of Jesus 
Christ from our official prayers? Should we be expeed to capitulate to those who would take Christ out 
of our religious holidays like Easter and Christmas and turn them o heathen business holidays? I think 
not! 

Should we as Christians meekly surrender to those who want "brainwash" our most precious 
source - our children - in the cessol of secular humanism in our government schools? 

Today, all over America, there is a concerted Jewish campaign "de-Christianize" Christian 
America. They want to remove the crosses from our military cemeteries. They want to erase every 
vestige of Christianity from our public life, while they infiltrate our Churches with their ison. 

They have the right, under American law to campaign for these issues. But they do not have the 
"moral right" to brand me and others like me as "hate mongers," and call for government investigations 
of our aivities, because we insist that America respe the name of Jesus Christ which brought us o 
existence 

Anyone who has ever made a study of early American history, knows this nation would never 
have come o being, if it had not been for men and women who believed and praiced - not "Judeo- 
Christianity" - but Bible Christianity. I believe that America's tradition is that of a Christian nation and 
we will fight* to the death any alien who tries to change it to fit their nefarious desires. 

Here is a few excerpts from another excellent little Booklet by My friend Jack Mohr 
THE PLOT TO DESTROY CHRISTIANITY BY LT. COL. GORDEN JACK MOHR 

The red terror always begins by eliminating the elleuals and the Christian leaders. I saw this 
first hand in South Korea in , when I was caught in an Abortive coup attempt against the South 
Korean government. In one ten day period, under the control of their Peoes Court over  people 
were brutally slaughtered in one small South Korean city. It was the Christian city of Sun'chon, in Chollo 
Nam Do Province, which bore the brunt of this savage attack. It was the Christian leaders and their 
families on whom the worst of the brutality fell. This has been the communist pattern world-wide. 

Communist leader Lustis said to his followeres: "Let us not carry on a war against individual 
persons, but let us exterminate the bourgeois` (property owners) as a class. Do not investigate through the 
study of documents or proofs, what the accused has done in words and deeds against Soviet authority. 
The first question to be aced before this is to what class does he belong, what is his origin, his 
education, his training, his profession." This is something American elleuals should think about, 
when they are tempted to promulgate the communist theory. 

During the first communist regime under Lenin, an investigating Committee in  rerted this 
incident: "The entire floor of a large garage was used as an execution site in the provincial city of Kiev. It 
was swimming with blood. It did not flow, but formed a layer several inches thick and was a grisly 
mixture of brain and skull fragments, as well as strands of hair and other human remains. 

"The entire walls were holed with thousands of bullets and were sattered with blood and 
fragments of brains as well as the skin that adhered to them. A ditch ran from the middle of the garage to

a subterranean outlet pipe. This drainage ditch was cm wide and cm deep. It was filled to the top 
with blood. 

"Immediately after the executions, the corpses were removed by loes or horse drawn carts and 
were buried in a mass grave. In one corner of the garden we found an older grave which contained some 
 corpses, in which we discovered the most varied and unimaginative cruelties and mutilations. There 
were corpses with their entrails removed; others had their eyes ked out and there were deep wounds in 
their hands, face and neck. Further on we found a corpse with an axe buried in its breast, while others had 
no tongues. In one corner of this mass grave, we discovered many arms, legs and severed trunks." 

You may be inclined at this  to say: "What a gross description. 

Who would believe it?" 

Well you better, if you want to stop it from coming here. I have seen worse in Korea. Have you 
ever seen a man impaled alive on a sharp bamboo le, while his pregnant wife is stripped before him 
and then raped over and over, before being chopped o pieces before his dying eyes? Have you ever 
seen a young woman stripped of her clothing, while she is nailed to a tree with spikes driven through her 
breasts and a bundle of rice straw, soaked in oil is bound between her bare thighs and set on fire? Have 
you ever seen an elderly nun crucified against the walls of her church, with bayonets driven through her 
hands and rib cage and listened for agonizing hours as she screamed, and cried, and begged for mercy 
from men who knew no mercy. Have you ever seen a tiny baby snatched from his mothers arms and then 
tossed back and forth between two drunken soldiers, as they caught the little body on the s of their 
bayonets? Of course you haven't and many of you are going to say or think: "How can you be so gross?" 
You don't even understand the meaning of the word "gross." I do, because I saw these things and had 
them praice on me. I swore before my God, that if He ever got me out of that mess, and safely back to 
the country I love and the people I love, I would do everything in my were to see that these things never 
happened in America. I can tell you without equivocation, that I get angry when I see ans underway in 
America, to bring that same kind of terror here. But look at the record. This terror is not unusual for 
Talmudic-Communism, they have done it to well over -million people in the past seventy years, what 
makes you think America is i mmune? 

In their textbook PSYCHOPOLITICS we read these words: "We have battled in America since 
the century's turn to bring to nothing any and all Christian influences and we are succeeding. While we 
today seem to be kind to Christians, remember we have yet to influence the Christian world to our ends. 
When that is done, we will have an end to them everywhere. 

Gus Hall (Hallerg), the perennial head of the American Communist Party has predied that - 
million Americans will be ruthlessly slaughtered when the communists take over. This is what the fight is 
all about! Wake Up! 

There is little doubt in my mind that many of you who read this message believe that the Lord 
will come back and "rapture" you out of this old world before this happens. I'm looking for His return 
too, not to take me out of the world, but to set things right as He has promised over and over again. 

Many of you who are so sure you won't be here when these things happen, have refused to do 
anything to keep them from happening. You are the ones who are to blame for the mess this country is in. 
Your Master told you to be the "salt of the earth," and instead, you have hidden in your spiritual 
foxholes, folding your holy hands in prayer, while you asked Him to do the dirty work He gave you to 
do. Now you feel He will remove you from the mess your apathy has caused. I want you to ask yourself a 
sime question: "Do you believe the early Christians might have felt the same way during the teble 
persecutions of the nd and rd centuries?" Do you think our Christian kinsmen in Russia might have felt 
that they too would be rescued before it happened to them? Yet we know that over -million have been 
slaughtered behind the Iron and Bamboo curtains in the past seventy years. Do you believe that you are 
better Christians then those who have suffered for the cause of Christ? Do you believe that you deserve 
to be rescued when they paid for their love of the Savior with their lives? Shame on you comacent

Christians who teach this Jewish fairy tale. Shame on your conceit! We know from the rerts of 
missionaries, that the reason hundreds of thousands of Chinese Christians died, when the communists 
took over that unhappy country, was because they had been taught no ( to worry, Jesus will come back 
and rapture you before it gets all that bad. Is that what American Christians are going to do? 

Now I know that some of you are going to be angry with me, because I have forced you to look at 
yourselves and you don't like what you see. But have patience and go with me a step farther and read 
Matthew . This was the chapter in which Christ was exaining to His discies, the events which 
would take ace before His return, at the end of this Age. Many pastors have tried to convince their 
people that Christ was speaking to and about Jews, in these Passages. He was noy! He was addressing 
His Christian followeres.

CHAPTER  What can you do? 

If you care to stop the coming comete enslavement of your self, your family, and America, join 
an organization and get involved. Become an aivist, which is some one who as. Peoe who stand 
for what they believe is right, and will fight for it. It is this kind of patriots we need, more than ever. It is 
hard for one person to achieve much by their self, but not imssible. Greatest results are usually 
achieved when working as a team. The author has gone o groups and churches, and changed the 
whole groups thinking on major issues several times, both on religion and litics. When you first start 
you will get some argument, but, as I said before, Truth will stand on its own bottom. TRUTH is the 
strongest wean we will ever have!
