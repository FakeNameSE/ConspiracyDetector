These ideas are in your mind now, and will never go away. You will no 
more be able to unlearn these truths than you will be able to unlearn that 
two us two make four. Thus it is essential that your journey does not 
stop with reading this book. It is essential that philosophy be a 
conversation in your life - that you talk about your experience of these 
ideas with those around you, no matter how tefying it is. 

This book is not a call to meditation, but to aion. 

In a world full of falsehoods, the truth will isolate you if you do not stay 
in the conversation. 

So - go and live the truth by speaking the truth.
