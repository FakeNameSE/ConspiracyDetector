bailout is obvious - the American public would have been outraged to find out that the Federal Reserve bailed out foreign banks 
while Americans were struggling to find jobs. 

To ace $ trillion o perspeive, remember that GDP of the United States is only $. trillion. The entire 
national debt of the United States government spanning its + year history is "only" $. trillion. The budget that is being 
debated so heavily in Congress and the Senate is "only" $. trillion. Take all of the outrage and debate over the $. trillion 
deficit o consideration, and swallow this Red pill: There was no debate about whether $,,,, would be given 
to failing banks and failing corrations around the world. 

In late , the TARP Bailout bill was passed and loans of $ billion were given to failing banks and companies. 
That was a blatant lie considering the fa that Goldman Sachs alone received  billion dollars. As is turns out, the Federal 
Reserve donated $. trillion to Citigroup, while Morgan Stanley received $. trillion. The Royal Bank of Scotland and 
Deutsche Bank, a German bank, sit about a trillion and numerous other banks received hefty chunks of the $ trillion. 

"This is a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, you're-on-your-own individualism for everyone else." - Bernie Sanders 

(l-VT) 

When you have conservative Republican stalwarts like Jim DeM(R-SC) and Ron Paul (R-TX) as well as self 
identified Democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders all fighting against the Federal Reserve, you know that it is no longer an 
issue of Right versus Left. When you have every single member of the Republican Party in Congress and progressive 
Congressmen like Dennis Kucinich snsoring a bill to audit the Federal Reserve, you realize that the Federal Reserve is an 
entity onto itself, which has no oversight and no accountability. 

Americans should be swelled with anger and outrage at the abysmal state of affairs when an uneleed group of 
bankers can create money out of thin air and give it out to megabanks and super corrations like Halloween candy. If the 
Federal Reserve and the bankers who control it believe that they can continue to devalue the savings of Americans and 
continue to destroy the US economy, they will have to face the realization that their trillion dollar pring presses will eventually 
under the world economy. 

The list of institutions that received the most money from the Federal Reserve can be found on page  of the GAO 
Audit and are as follows..

With their profits the banks will acquire all the nations` lands, and natural resources. At some 
 soon they will own the entire world, including the people, who have become slaves, and the armies, 
including the Army of the United Nations, which they already control through the U. N. Then just as 
they did in World War , the Bankers loaned great sums of money at erest to Germany, England, 
Russia, France, Italy and the U.S.A., money to finance their war against each other. It was a banker`s 
war as all wars are. A super book is out called WAR CYCLES PEACE CYCLES by RICHARD 
KELLY HOSKINS, P.O. Box , Lynchburg, Virginia  Phone ---. This author with 
a Biblical background, documents who started and financed every war in History, going back over , 
years, and most of the wars were in cycles  years apart. It will change your entire outlook on History! 
It`s well documented, and a real eye opener. 

Thomas Jefferson once gave some great advice: "/ believe that banking institutions are more 
dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy 
that has set the government at defiance. The issuing were should be taken from the banks and 
restored to the people to whom it properly belongs. 

If the American people ever allow the banks to control issuance of their currency [Federal 
Reserve Notes], first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corrations that will grow up 
around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake homeless on the 
continent their fathers occupied." 

The above prophecy has come true; for many years in this country a man could own his home 
freehold, with no taxes, whatsoever on his property. He had what is called alodial title.  Or 
freehold title to his property. Allodium is probably one of the most fundamental and most sacred 
rights, which a free man can ssess. A free man can live his life in total independence, free from 
government inflationary dominance, and live his life in a state of absolute self-sufficiency. And we 
could all do that in America, if we weren`t slaves to that FRB, and it wasn`t sucking the life out of 
everyone in this country, and the world. There was a time, in America and England, which such a way of 
life existed, before the Jew bankers. 

In most states, all lands within the State were declared to be allodial, and feudal tenures (Land 
lords) were prohibited. Lasting economic prosperity cannot exist, where there is no economic freedom, 
and no right to own tax-free property. Now we are not only taxed on our property, but also our own 
labor to improve it. Remember it was the judges and Congressmen, who took all these rights from us, 
while telling us the lie that it is for our own proteion. Now the Cities, Counties and States have 
mortgaged all of our homes and land to the ernational bankers. Most of the taxes we pay on our 
homes go to these bankers in the form of erest on borrowed money, money that should not have 
been borrowed. What are we going to do when this false economy collapses, and there is no money 
to pay this usurious erest with and they will foreclose taking people`s homes like they do today? 

MONEY THEN COMES POWER 

Fifty years ago the Author was told by a lawyer friend; WE LAWYERS IN AMERICA HAVE 
A HAY-DAY COMING. He went on to brag; With the way we are getting laws passed and 


Page  of  


comicating the legal system, it can`t be anything but a hay-day or bonanza coming for us. We`ve got it 
made! 

He also told me; My life`s ambition is to become a judge. I asked him why? He told me that; 
to have were over other men`s lives is the ultimate goal of most men. The were to punish others is 
next to having the were of God. I still don`t understand this, but the people of this country better wake 
up, and find a way to strip away, this totalitarian were. We don`t need a master. Let`s not forget, in 
Europe only the King or head of state is sovereign, in American the people are supsed to be the 
sovereigns (kings) and the government the servant. The American people, being a trustful, honest, and 
for the most part good people, have lost their sovereign rights; our public servants have usurped their 
were. Now we have a government, which meddles in every facet of our lives. Let`s get back to We 
the people, ruling our country and limit the government to its Constitutional bounds. When the people 
are scared of government, we have TYRANNY; when the government is afraid of the people, we have 
LIBERTY! Today America has gone overboard on punishing people, while refusing to listen to the 
real reasons people do wrong. Exame; the unbiblical debt everybody is in, with the bankers sucking at 
least % of the top of every transaion, every year. Slaves rea and sometimes they over-rea. 

The critical  in the fateful usury- inflation cycle slipped by us in the dark confusion of the 
great depression, about . F.D. Roosevelt a Zionist, called in the gold, took America off our sound 
economic standard of "substance" (gold and silver) and put us on a paper debt-money system, of money 
(borrowed by our treasury from the private Zionist bank called Federal Reserve, which is neither 
Federal nor a Reserve), but a credit system that issues debt notes, in ace of real money, as you can 
prove to yourself, by just looking at the top of any Federal Reserve note. (A note is a debt, the
