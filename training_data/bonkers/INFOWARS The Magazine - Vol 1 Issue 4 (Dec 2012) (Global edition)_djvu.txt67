"SO LOOK, THERE ARE FIFTEEH 
MILLION VOTES OUT WERE WE 
HAVEN'T COUNTED YET. WHAT DO 
YOU WANT TO DO?" 

"HOW LONG HAVE THE POLLS 

BEEN CLOSED?" 
"LET'S SEE. TWO HOURS." 

"THE HELL WITH IT. LET'S CALL 

IT A DEFEAT FOR PROP ." 
"OKAY." 

This isn't over. 
We're not just looking at how many votes in 
California are still uncounted. We're not just 
guessing how it'll turn out and making little 
projeions. That's a sucker's game. 

We're looking at real symptoms of fraud, and fraud 
has tentacles and arms. If you see one piece of fraud, 
you keep digging for other pieces. You usually find them. 

Start with the incredibly early projeions made by 
media outlets on eleion night. Those projeions 
sank Prop . 

When you're in the middle of a football game and the 
outcome is still in doubt, if somebody suddenly sts 
the final score on the scoreboard, that's called a lie. 

It isn't an estimate or a guess or a prediion. It's a lie. 

There was once a day in American litics when news 
networks would wait for conclusive eleion results. 
They weren't greedily bent on rerting projeions 
soon and sooner and soonest. 

So let's get that projeion-brainwashing out of our 
heads, all right?
