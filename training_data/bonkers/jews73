Authors Note: Seven years before the war in the New York Times below we hear the reason for 
stopping all trade with Germany. This went a long way in starting the war. Germany had almost no 
farm land and lived on manufaured goods they made to trade for food with Spein and other countries. 
Most land in Germany is to rocky to farm. So the Zionist stopped them from selling their manufaured 
goods out of the country and caused famine in Germany where all people had to eat was Cabbach abd 
boiled grass but you won`t hear this in the national press or T.V. 

"Each of you, Jew and Gentile alike, who has not already enlisted in this sacred war, should do so 
now and here. It is not sufficient that you should buy no goods made in Germany. You must refuse 
to deal with any merchant or shopkeeper who sells any German-made goods or who patronizes 
German ships or shipping.... we will undermine the Hitler regime and bring the German people to 
their senses by destroying their exrt trade on which their very existence depends." - Samuel 
Undermeyer, in a Radio Broadcast on WABC, New York (August , , rerted in the New York 
Times, August , ) (This was a Jewish Leader speaking in a major News Paper  years before 
the War.) 

"Joining with Samuel Untermeyer in calling for a war against Germany, Bernard Baruch, at the 
same time, was promoting preparations for war against Germany. 'I emphasized that the defeat of 
Germany and Japan and their elimination from world trade would give Britain a tremendous oprtunity 
to swell her foreign commerce in both volume and profit."' - Baruch, The Public Years, by Bernard M. 
Baruch (p.) [Samuel Untermeyer was a Jewish leader and close friend of presidents Wilson and 
Roosevelt. Bernard Baruch was a presidential adviser to Wilson, Roosevelt and Truman.]

war'. This war was to be caed out against Germany to its conclusion, to her destruion". - Dr.

"For months now the struggle against Germany is waged by each Jewish community, at 
each conference, in all our syndicates, and by each Jew all over the world. There is reason to 
believe that our part in this struggle has general value. We will trigger a spiritual and material war 
of all the world against Germany's ambitions to become once again a great nation, to recover lost 
tetories and colonies. But our Jewish erests demand the comete destruion of Germany. 
Colleively and individually, the German nation is a threat to us Jews." - Vladimir Jabotinsky 
(founder of the Jewish terrorist group, Irgun Zvai Leumi) in Mascha Rjetsch, January,  (also quoted 
in Histoire de I'Arme Allemande by Jacques Benoist-Mechin, Vol. IV, p. ). 

"Hitler will have no war (does not want war), but we will force it on him, not this year, but 
soon." - Emil Ludwig Cohn in Les Annales, June,  (also quoted in his book The New Holy Alliance).

"We want to bring about a deep hatred for the Germans, for German soldiers, sailors, and 
airmen. We must hate until we win." - Lord Beaverbrook, quoted in Niemals! by Heinrich Goitsch.

do so in a way entirely consonant with the general scheme of British aion, and therefore would ace

"We are not denying and are not afraid to confess that this war is our war and that it is 
waged for the liberation of Jewry... Stronger than all fronts together is our front, that of Jewry. We 
are not only giving this war our financial suprt on which the entire war produion is based, we 
are not only providing our full propaganda Dowere which is the moral energy that keeps this war 
going. The guarantee of viory is predominantly based on weakening the enemy forces, on destroying 
them in their own country, within the resistance. And we are the Trojan horses in the enemy's 
fortress. Thousands of Jews living in Europe constitute the principal faor in the destruion of our

CHRISTIANS BEWARE OF THE MISLED PREACHERS 

In dealing with any controversial subje such as Zionist International Judaism and its Satanic 
offspring Zionism and Communism, it is often difficult to get a message of warning across to those who 
are in the most immediate danger. This is due to the fa that the Christian world has become so 
brainwashed in the liberal mind detergent of Zionism`s propaganda, that immediately, when one 
speaks of a Jew in any but the most comimentary terms, he is saddled with the hoble accusation of 
being anti-Semite. This has stifled honest discussion of this tremendous problem. 

This book has been written specifically to Christians who have been misled by their Church 
leaders, o believing the Myth that the Jews of today are the God`s Chosen Peoe of the 
OLD TESTAMENT and they must be afforded only the most courteous treatment, no matter what 
evil they may do; to do less will cause the curse of God to descend on this country, or so their religious
