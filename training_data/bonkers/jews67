one of the most renowned authorized Church Fathers. Sa Louis (Ludwig), King of France, 
exemary in his saliness and Christian love of the neighbor, who was so magnanimous as to 
give back a conquered king of the regions conquered by him, which no one in that time did 
voluntarily, was of the opinion that the Jews, if they mocked the Christian religion, should have a 
sword thrust as deey as ssible o their body." () 

St. Athanasius, the great Church Father, asserted that the Jews were no longer the people of God 
but were Lords over Sodom and Gomorrah." () 

Sa John Chrysostom, another great Church Father, rerts concerning all the misfortune, which 
occurred to the Jews at different times: "But the Jews say that men and not God brought them all this

misfortune. But exaly the opsite is the cause, for God has occasioned it. If they (the Jews) make men 
resnsible for this, then they must remember that they, even if they had risked it, would nevertheless not 
have been strong enough, if God had not so willed it." () St. John Chrysostom defined approximately 
fifteen hundred years ago clearly and distinly the nature of the Jews and described them as "Nation of 
criminals," "lustful robbers and avaricious false thieves." Later the great Church Father makes the 
assurance in conneion with the traditional Jewish taic of lamenting that men declare war on them and 
destroy them, and of always representing themselves as innocent viims: "Always when the Jews say to 
you: Men have waged war un us and have conspired against us, answere them: men would not have 
waged war un you, if God had not allowed it." 

Sa John Chrysostom even suprts himself un another  of the Catholic dorine, that 
"God hates the Jews," () because God hates Evil, and the Jews after they had our Lord Jesus 
crucified, became the greatest evil. 

The teble events in this century, where the Jews ereed their Communist diatorship, have 
confirmed what Sa John Chrysostom asserted over fifteen hundred years ago, namely, that the Jews 
are a band of thieves and murderers, and it is understandable that the just punishment of God is 
frequently bestowed un them for their bloody misdeeds. 

The renowned Bishop of Meaux, Bossuet, writer and sacred preacher, whose sition is known in 
the history of Holy Church, likewise fought the Jews energetically and cursed them from the pulpit: 
"Accursed Peoe! Your visitation shall pursue you up to your most remote descendants, until the Lord 
becomes weary of punishing you and at the end of time takes pity on your wretched remains." () 

Like all Church Fathers Bossuet knew the Jewish falsehood very well. If the Jews had not 
behaved in a criminal way in the course of centuries since the crucifying of the Lord, no one would 
accuse and condemn them on account of their wickedness. Through their mode of aion they are solely 
and alone resnsible for the all-sided reaion against them. If a man does not wish to be regarded as a 
murderer and thief, then he only needs to abandon this kind of crime. But if he robs, kills or conspires, it 
is not remarkable, that the peoples affeed reproach him with his crimes. However, the Jews are 
shameless enough to protest and to always raise a great outcry, 'persecution', and yet it is because of their 
own conspiracies and manifold crimes against other men and nations which brings such censure un 
them. 

The Holy Pius V another great sa of the church, who is renowned on account of his devoutness 
and Christian neighborly love and was simultaneously one of the most highly regarded of Popes, gave 
energetic expression to his opinion - and ordered, that all Jews should wear as distinguishing mark a cap 
for men and a sime sign for women and we declare that the color must be yellow.

This same Pope committed, that: "Since we, as is necessary, wish to remedy this deceit which 
Jews are continually committing, with full understanding and in exercising of the astolic weres, we 
withdraw from the Jews and their rule (and recognize no right of claim) all properties, which the Jews 
have in their ssession in this city Rome or other aces of our domain of rule." () One can imagine, 
how great the usury and swindling of the Jews and the sale of properties must have been, that this devout 
virtuous Pope saw himself compelled to take these measures for defense of the Christians. If he had lived 
in our disastrous time, he would have been condemned by the Church dignitaries in the service of the 
"Synagogue of Satan," of race hatred and Anti-Semitism and, if ssible, even have been included 
among the war criminals of Nuremberg; for in our time the "Fifth Column", "The Establishment" or 


Page  of  



whatever you want to call it, condemns all who defend their peoples of Holy Church against the litical 
or economic Imperialism of the Jews. The invasion of our Churches by an atheist and pro-Marxist, 
Walter Reuther who is using a million dollars of funds from his United Auto Workers to 'buy' and 
organize religious organizations and all churches affiliated with "The National Council of Churches of 
Christ". And Dr. Eugene Carson Blake who made the statement not too long ago: "With prudent 
management, the churches ought to be able to control the whole economy within the prediable future." 

This Jewish Fifth Column has become a deadly danger to Christianity everywhere and it has 
solidified itself well in America. As Christians united however, we will stop the wickedness of the Jews. 
This must be done for the benefit of humanity and a better world in which to life. 

(This author in the year  can easily see how the Catholic Church after reading the 
above and all the old Popes and Sas have had the wisdom and fore sight to know how bad the 
Jews are and warned the world about them. Now one can easily see that the Catholic Church is not 
led by God when today the present Pope is a Jew and the last Pope was also a Jew. Think about 
that! Then try to tell me the Jews are not taking over the world starting with the Catholic 
Protestant Church`s.) 

THE PLAGUE OF HUMANITY 

Yes, that is frequently the way the Jews have been referred to since the beginning of history. 
Why? There must be reasons for them to have earned this distinion. Perhaps it is for these same reasons 
that the Jews have been expelled from countries throughout the world. Yes, it is true according to 
history that the Jews have been banished from most all major nations of the world at one time or
