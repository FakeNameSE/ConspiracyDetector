OF GOD and HOLY SCRIPTURES. This law also declared  as a Year of the Bible. Now they 
and the courts ignore that law, as though it had never been passed. Why? LET`S WAKE THEM UP! 

This country was settled as a Christian nation, with the Holy Bible as its supreme law of the 
land, as several Supreme Court decisions affirm. One Supreme court case Stated; Our Laws and our 
institutions must necessarily be based un and embrace the teachings of the Redeemer Of 
Mankind...It is imssible that it should be otherwise; and in this sense and to this extent our 
civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian. THIS CASE ALSO CITED OR QUOTED 
EIGHTY SEVEN-OTHER SUPREME COURT DECISIONS (PRECEDENT CASES) THAT GAVE 
LIKE DECISIONS AND WENT ON TO SAY THERE WERE MANY MORE SUPREME COURT 
CASES; NEVERTHELESS,  WAS SUFFICIENT TO PROVE IT  Supreme Court case of 
Church of the holy Trinity v. United States. 

Another Supreme Court case Peoe v. Ruggles (), ruled that: 

. Whoever strikes at the root of Christianity tends manifestly to the dissolution of civil 
government 

. An attack on Jesus Christ was an attack on the United States. The man received three 
Months time in prison for blasphemy. 

Still another Supreme Court Case Vidal V. Gerard () Morality was to be taught from the 
New Testament 

All of the above Supreme Court cases confirm the  Supreme Court case Runkel v. 
Winemiller w hich ruled; By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established 
religion... and all ses and denominations of Christians are aced un the same equal footing. 

Today instead of taking the oldest Supreme Court cases, to make a ruling on current cases 
being decided, the judges use the most modern liberalized decisions ssible, decisions which 
deliberately rob us and eat away our constitutional rights. They totally ignore the old decisions made 
when the U.S. Constitution was the supreme law of the land, which was founded on Biblical principals. 
They should use the cases nearest to our founding fathers, which had lived in tyranny, and won the 
independence of our nation with the blood of themselves and their relatives. If they want to use this 
damnable praice of STARE DECISIS, (once decided always decided) in ace of letting the jury decide 
a case, these older cases have a lot more merit than recent cases decided by Liberal judges using 
tampered juries will ever have. The Judges are tampering with the Juries in a hundred ways in 
modern courts. But what can you do about it? Go to another judge who is doing the same thing? But 
then who controls our government today? 

From the above you can easily see there was no separation of Church and State when 
America was a Christian nation, before the Zionists took control. Then we let another religion (the 
anti Christian scribes and Pharisees (Jews), with their money changers or bankers, the Edomites sken 
of in the Bible with their lies about the (separation of Church and State) and push our Bible and Christian 
morals aside. Then reace them with a strange god, and the laws, taken from their religious books the 
anti Christian Talmud the vilest foulest set of religious books ever pred. We the people of this 
Country have surrendered our sovereignty and our DE JURE government to the DE FACTO Zionist

government, run by he scribes and Pharisees Zionists (Jews). Then we let them take over and rule our 
country, its congress, its courts, its banking system, its schools, its morals, its news media, its Churches 
and its entertainment industry. Can our government be mled by two Gods? Soon the Christians will 
have to go underground to teach from their own Bible! Remember, it`s you that is being pushed out! 
Think about it! ARE YOU A MAN OR A MOUSE? 

The unorganized civilian militia (minute men), the Jural Societies, the Common Law 
Courts, the constitutional clubs, and other patriots` organizations are beginning to take notes too. 
They will surprise you at how many silent patriots, can be aivated when they identify a common 
ENEMY, and they undertake a just aion. We must always remember the definition of a true patriot 
is; someone that will defend the moral and constitutional rights of someone you detest, as well as a 
friend. If you don`t stand for something, you will fall for anything. An attack on one of us must be 
considered an attack on all of us! We are at war! WE DID NOT START THIS WAR, THEY DID! 
BUT WHO IS GOING TO WIN IT? 

The militia or minute men. contrary to what the news media tells us, comes from local men 
dedicated to the preservation of the U.S. Constitution, especially the nd amendment. (Our nd 
amendment is the teeth of the U.S. Constitution). The militia is not a nationwide organization, with 
nationwide leaders, although the local leaders do have conta with each other in many ways. The title 
minuteman was descriptive of the fa that militia members could a in a minute, to repel an 
enemy, Men that could shoot straight and duck. The enemy was the government. The government 
could knock out one force or militia, only to have another ten more p up. There was no Capitol or 
central headquarters that they could destroy to eliminate the patriots. Today if you want to meet a good 
bunch of Patriotic men and women, go to a Militia meeting and just listen to what goes on among these 
good people. It is not the lies the Zionist news media tell us. 

These militia men were guided by a common princie (freedom), and there fore worked 
cohesively. There was no need for a formal central authority. They call this unity. Our forefathers, like 
us today, did not agree on every thing. There were differences of opinion. They belonged to Different 
Churches, but they were of a single mind when it came to defining an enemy, (anyone that deprives 
us of freedom) and what was to be done about it. 

It was said; "I f every person has the right to defend - even by force - his person, his 
liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize 
and suprt a common force to prote these rights constantly." FROM A GOOD BOOK 
 The Law, by Frederick Bastiat The government wants to reduce the governed, to the status of 
animals in the field, that have no free will and thus no control over their personal destiny or their private 
property. The Jews even in their religious books the Talmud even call us animals or goyim! 

Property rights are also sacred! God gave man dominion over the earth, which includes the 
produs of the earth, as they are considered in there natural State. God gave the produs of the earth for 
the use of men to better his life; therefore there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some 
way or another, before they can be of any use to a person. It follows that when man removes any thing 
from nature, he has mixed his labor with it, something of his own, and thereby makes it his own personal 
property. By adding his labor to it excludes the common right of others; because this labor being the 
unquestionable property of the laborer, no man but he can have a right (or be the proprietor of), his own 
aions and labor. That which a man honestly acquires by his labor, which we call property, it certainly 
follows, that no other man or government can have a right to the person, or property of another. 

If a man has a right to his person and property: he has also the right to defend them, and a right to 
all the necessary means of defense, and so has a right of punishing all rusions or insults un his 
person and property. This is what government was ended to prote.

Before we start o some of the Government restriions aced un Churches we must ask 
where did the Zionist owned I. R. S. get their rules? Did they get them out of the Bible? Or did they just 
make them up as a litical way to control the American Churches and Peoe? 

TO MAINTAIN THEIR  ( C )  TAX-EXEMPT STATUS, A CHURCH MUST: 

. Give up their Immunity on taxes and governmental control. 

. Trade their God given rights and heritage for Government granted privileges. 

. Be incorrated. 

. Have a recognized creed and IRS approved worship. 

. Have a definite and distin ecclesiastical government, an hierarchical government. 

. Have IRS approved code of dorine and disciine. 

. Be a denomination with a distin religious history. 

. Have ordained ministers approved by the IRS.. 

. Have ministers educated in State accredited colleges. 

. Be neutral on litical issues. 

. Have tax exempt status issued by IRS instead of Immunity from Taxes as Churches always have 
been. 

. Pay a tax to the IRS for tax-exempt status. 

. Be engaged in aivities furthering exclusively public purses. 

. Open its services to the public. 

. Have their pastor answere to the IRS as to the daily aivities of the Church. 

. Let IRS be privy to all financial transaions including sources, donors, expenditures, and if cash is 
used the leadership will be a likely suspe of money laundering.
