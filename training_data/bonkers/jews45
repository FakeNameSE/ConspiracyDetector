money, Gifts, prostitutes, loans, lucrative Jobs for the congressman family and all manner of bribes, to 
get special erest legislation or laws passed for the Bankers and their Corrations, to rob the American 
people more. One way they operate is to buy a piece of property, house or automobile and then sell it to 
the Congressman at a big loss so that the Congressman can sell it for a big profit and their are many more 
ways they bribe them. 


WHAT FAMIOUS MEN HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE JEWS 
TWAIN, MAR K (S. L. Clemens). th c. American writer. 

In the U.S. cotton states, after the war ... the Jew came down in force, set up shop on the antation, 
supied all the negroes' wants on credit, and at the end of the season was the proprietor of the negro's 
share of the present crop and part of the next one. Before long, the whites detested the Jew. 

() The Jew is being legislated out of Russia. The reason is not concealed. The movement was 
instituted because the Christian peasant stood no chance against his commercial abilities. The Jew was 
always ready to lend on a crop. When settlement day came, he owned the crop; the next year he owned 
the farm ” like Joseph. 

() In the England of John's time everybody got o debt to the Jew. 

() He gathered all lucrative enterprises o his hands. He was the King of Commerce. He had to be 
banished from the realm. For like reasons, Spain had to banish him  years ago, and Austria a coue 
of centuries later. 

In all ages Christian Europe has been obliged to curtail his aivities. If he entered un a trade, the 
Christian had to retire from it. If he set up as a door, he took the business. If he exoited agriculture, 
the other farmers had to get at something else. The law had to step in to save the Christian from the or- 
house. Still, almost bereft of emoyments, he found ways to make money. Even to get rich. This history 
has a most sordid and praical commercial look. Religious prejudices may account for one part of it, but 
not for the other nine. 

Protestants have persecuted Catholics ” but they did not take their livelihoods away from them. 
Catholics have persecuted Protestants ” but they never closed agriculture and the handicrafts against 
them. I feel convinced that the Crucifixion has not much to do with the world's attitude toward the Jew; 
that the reasons for it are much older than that event. 

I am convinced that the persecution of the Jew is not in any large degree due to religious prejudice. 
No, the Jew is a money-getter. He made it the end and aim of his life. He was at it in Rome. He has been 
at it ever since. His success has made the whole human race his enemy. 

You will say that the Jew is everywhere numerically feeble. When I read in the Cyclopedia 
Britannica that the Jewish pulation in the United States was , I wrote the editor and exained 
to him that I was personally acquaed with more Jews than that, and that his figures were without doubt 
a mispr for ,,. Peoe told me that they had reasons to suspe that for business reasons, 
many Jews did not rert themselves as Jews. It looks ausible. I am strongly of the opinion that we 
have an immense Jewish pulation in America. I am assured by men competent to speak that the Jews 
are exceedingly aive in litics... ("Concerning the Jews," Harper's Monthly Magazine, September 
) 

Twain's opinion on the Jews is probably the best-kept secret in American literary history. Immediately after his 
death, his eccentric daughter Clara maed ” or was maed by ” the Jewish piano ayer, Ossip Gabrilowitsch.

CHAPTER  

JURY DUTY 

IF YOU EVER SIT ON A JURY PLEASE REMEMBER 
YOUR RIGHTS AS A JUROR 
WHICH, THE JUDGES and PROSECUTORS 
DON`T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT 

The Constitution also gave us five checks and balances to prove a law by. 

. If any person looks at a law and sees the law, to be unjust, immoral, unconstitutional, 
unscriptural, a law he would not keep himself, nor submit himself to, he can lawfully refuse to obey it 
and refuse to find anyone guilty of breaking that law. 

. If a liceman or other public servant looks at a law, and sees the law to be unjust, or 
immoral, a law he would not keep himself, nor submit himself to, he can lawfully refuse to enforce it. 
Today there are thousands of laws on the books lice don`t or won`t enforce. 

. If a prosecuting attorney looks at a law, and sees the law to be unjust, immoral, a law he 
would not keep himself, nor submit himself to, he can lawfully refuse to prosecute the accused. 

. If a judge looks at a law and sees the law, to be unjust, immoral, a law he would not keep 
himself, nor submit himself to, he can lawfully refuse to judge, or find one guilty for breaking it. 

NEXT THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT A PROSPECTIVE 
JUROR HAS, IF CALLED FOR JURY DUTY 

Last but not least is the final check and balance, in our justice system. Anyone (a single 
individual) called to serve on a jury, has a duty too; regardless of what the judge or prosecuting attorney 
instru them to do, to first; look at a law and see if it is a Constitutional law, is the law just or unjust, or 
immoral, a law he would not keep himself, nor submit himself to, he can then, and must follow his own 
conscience and, by himself  lawfully refuse  to vote another man guilty, for not obeying the unjust law, 
thereby exercising the fa that He As a jurist, and He alone is the most wereful man on earth, (even 
more wereful than the judge giving him instruions), and set the man free, regardless how the other 
jurors vote. So we find the individual, a liceman, a public servant, a prosecuting attorney, a 
judge, or the individual juror all have the were to find a bad law is in fa NO LAW AT ALL! 
This my friend is America at its best!! Let`s get it back for everyone! 

STARE DECISIS IS BAD LAW! 

It takes away the Judges and Jury`s were to use their own 
judgment or discretion to decide a Persons degree of guilt or 
innocence and more. 

Basic princies the informed Juror must consider. 

Before we can determine what is wrong, we must identify what is right. Also what we have lost when we 
went from the ALMIGHTY`S sime Ten Commandments and a few sime common sense rules in the Bible that 
later became our common law. These are our unalienable God given rights. This was gradually reaced by what 
we have today in America; Its called commercial law, or Roman Merchant law which is the law of the sea or 
(Admiralty law,) that has come on the land. Today it is commonly called "Equity law." Its handmaiden is 
STARE DECISIS, commonly called " case law," based on thousands of volumes of big law books that are 
growing every year. (We have more than three million laws today in the U.S.A.). It takes trained lawyers years to

even become familiar with a small segment of them. This system is the "Beast" that the Bible tells us will come out 
of the sea in Rev. : to . We have let the judges steal away our God given common law and put this ungodly 
"Beast" in our midst. A prophecy fulfilled. 

THE OVERTHROW OF THE AMERICAN LAW SYSTEM WAS STARTED BY A SOCIALIST 
TEACHER BY THE NAME OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS LANGDELL, DEAN OF HARVARD 
LAW SCHOOL. In all probability he was a Zionist. He decided that judges should guide the "evolution" of the 
U.S. Constitution. In the late th century, he roduced the case law study method under which students would 
study "former judges` decisions" rather than the U.S. Constitution. 

Today we struggle against the comex morass of indecipherable opinions that pass for law in America. 
Then all we can do is shake our heads in disgust. Who can make sense of it all? 

It must be clearly understood that, in America, court decisions (though they may call 
them case law) are not law at all, but merely decisions of a court apicable only to the 
case at hand that they were meant for. They may be good decisions, and they may be bad, 
but in a legitimate government, they take away the prerogative of unanimous-consensus of 
a properly empanelled jury which has aed independently of a judge or prosecutor, according 
to the diates of their conscience! If the judge or prosecutor has tampered with the jury in 
any of the ways laid out in this book, how can the decision have any validity in the case at 
hand, or any other future case? Case law is another way of Jury tampering big time. 

Other law schools quickly followed Harvard Law School, seeing more money for the money-sucking 
vacuum cleaners called lawyers. As a result, the ideas found in Blackstone`s Commentaries on the Law , t he law 
book of the founding fathers and of American courts for well over a century, the concepts resnsible for making 
this country great, were discarded. Law professors deemed Blackstone`s an outdated approach to law because it 
taught that certain things were always wrong (moral absolutes) and did not change, specifically those related 
to human morality and behavior, a Christian type view. Today instead of going back to the oldest, 
soundest court decisions to base a court decision on, one that followed the great thoughts and moral values laid out 
by our founding fathers, that made this country great and good, the courts always use the latest most liberalized, 
socialist, court decisions that can be found. Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes exained in the s The U.S. 
Constitution is what the judges say it is. One Judge told the author Today the law is what the last S.O.B. on the
