In many cases, the Fundamentalists have been the easiest targets, since they have been taught the lies that 
the Jewish dorine of Pre-Millennialism. And that the people we know as Jews, are the Chosen Peoe of the 
Old Testament which is simy PROPAGANDA, the greatest deception, ever praiced in Christianity. These 
people, who are attempting to destroy Christianity, are held up as the ape of God`s eye, and Church members 
are sternly warned that they must never criticize a Jew, since God will punish them if they do. 

What about the  or more promises God made to Israel? Did the Jews get even one of 
these promises? The answere is definitely NO! I will give an exame: 

Gen.: -  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any 
more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. ; And God said unto him, 
I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiy; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and 
kings shall come out of thy loins. 

Remember also Genesis :- I will make thee exceeding fruit-full, and I will make nations 
of the, and kings shall come out of thee.  And I will establish my Covent between me and thee and

thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy 
seed after thee. 

Questions: The Jews are not the many nations, they are just one little Parasitic nation, who 
can`t live without the $,. dollars, welfare for every man, woman and child in Israel every year, 
which is taken from the American tax payers and given to Israeli by the Zionist American Politicians. 
Unlike the true  tribes of Israel, who true history, proves beyond any doubt, they are the true Israel 
people, who migrated north from the Bible lands, and settled the European and Scandinavian countries, 
and spread out to America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa etc fulfilling this prophecy. 
There are many books on this migration. There are lots of good churches that have book stores, with 
histories and migrations of the  tribes. They are generally called by the Zionist Jews; IDENTITY 
CHURCHES a name I don`t like, but they have lots of truth. Also show me the Kings the above 
scripture promises to Israel. Show me any king the Jews ever had besides King Herod who killed all the 
babies under  years of age. Yet all the Europe and Scandinavian Countries have always had Kings. In 
Genesis : GOD said to Abraham. / Isaac shall thy seed be called. "Are the Jews called sons of Isaac, 
or Isaacsons, or Sacksons, or Saxons? Yet the white Europeans are called Celto-Anglo Saxons. 
There are hundreds of scriptures in the Old or New Testament, which proves beyond doubt, the 
Jews who occupy Israel today, are not now, nor have they ever been Israel, if you are not to brain 
washed, to find them and understand what you are reading. 

The false premise held by Rev. Jerry Falwell, and other so-called Christian Fundamentalist that the Jews 
are God`s chosen people, is not simy the result of their blindness, to the true identity of the house of Israel. 
Much of their confusion on the whole matter arises from their failure to investigate the historical background of 
Zionist World Jewry, and they are already making a lot of money, with what they preach. 

The Jewish Historian Benjamin H. Freedman`s book, Fas are fas, Concerning the major part of 
World Jewiy, he wrote:  What secret mysterious were has been able for countless generations 
to keep the origin and history of the Khazars and the Khazar Kingdom out of our history 
textbooks and out of the classroom courses of history throughout the world? 

'The origin and history of the Khazars and the Khazar Kingdom are incontestable 
fas. ..(which) establish beyond any question of doubt the origin and history of the self 
styled 'Jew' in Eastern Europe. ...one of history's best kept secrets until wide publicity was 
given in recent years." 

Freedman, who is himself a Jew, exains further: "Popular ignorance of the real basis of 
litical Zionism is beyond calculation. Vaguely most Christians have the idea that the 
Jews claim on Palestine because it was the 'Promised Land' in which they lived for a 
period a few centuries that ended , years ago. And the thought of a people returning 
to its ˜ homeland ' seems emotionally satisfying and good. 

"But here are the fas most Americans do not know:" 

"Political Zionism is almost exclusively a movement by the Jews of Europe: But these 
Eastern European Jews have neither a racial nor an historic conneion with Palestine. 
Their ancestors were not inhabitants of the 'Promised Land'. They are the dire 
decedents of the Khazar Kingdom, which existed until the  th century." 

' The Khazars were a non Semitic, Turko-Finn, Mongolian (ASIAN) tribal people 
who, about the  st century A.D., emigrated from Middle-Asia to Eastern Europe. There 
they created one of the largest Kingdoms of their time. At its greatest extent it covered 
an area of about , square miles. About the th century A.D., the King of the 
Khazars adopted J ud'aism as the state religion, and the majority of inhabitants joined 
him in the new allegiance. Before that date there was no such thing as a Khazar who was 
a J ew. Neither then or since was there such a thing as a Khazar whose ancestors had 
come from the Holy Land. 

"In view of this fa, what comes of the cry for 'repatriation' to the 'homeland'? 
These Eastern European, Yiddish-speaking J ews have no historic or racial conneion with 
Palestine, or for that matter, with the other Jews who existed in other countries for 
thousands of years prior to the Khazar conversion."

God speaking to Edom In the Bible: Malachi :- "f have loved you saith the LORD. Yet ye 
say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Saith the LORD: yet I 
loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste.... 

 Whereas Edom saith, We are imverished, but we will return and build the 
desolate aces; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and 
they shall call them, the border ( tetory) of wickedness, and, The people against whom 
the LORD hath indignation for ever" 

In the rd chapter of Matthew, Jesus identifies His enemies the Jews, as being of the serpent 
seed line which He traces back to Cain. 

Today the Jews masquerade, as the LORD`S chosen people is undoubtedly the greatest hoax in history. 

And as H.G. Wells wrote: "i the idea of belonging to a chosen race predestined to 
preeminence was very attraive one" If they could foist themselves off on the world as Israel, 
their grandiose ambitions for world domination would be greatly enhanced. They began to claim 
Abraham for their father, and thrust their company un the remnant of the true Judaites in Babylon. 
Wells went on to write 'The main part of J ewry was never in J udea ( Palestine) . " 

Ez. :. ˜There for thus saith the LORD God; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have 
I sken against the residue of the heathen, and against all I dumia, which have 
aped my land o there ssession." 

In the age long Esau-ldumean conspiracy to disace the seed of Jacob in order to seize 
Israel's inheritance, the most heinous a, was the Idumean Herod's ot to murder the Christ Child. 
His motive was to make certain that no legitimate seed of Israel should arise to claim his kingship. 
Mat: :. 

When Jesus said, the Scribes and Pharisees (JEWS) sit in Moses seat," he meant they had 
taken control of the Government, as they have the Governments in America and Europe. 

The Esau - Edom - Idumean Conneion 

No more subtle deception was ever perpetuated, by the father of lies, than Christendom`s 
acceptance of the counterfeit Israeli state of Palestine, and its barbarous theft of the land from the or 
Palestinian people. Christian Theologians and Evangelists, have given credibility to the specious claim, 
that the enemies of our LORD and his Kingdom are the chosen people, rather than the Celtic-Anglo- 
Saxons, who are the true House of Israel in the world today. The ultimate irony, inherent in the Jews` 
spurious claim, to be the decedents of Jacob-Israel, is the fa that mainstream of world Jewry, is anually 
the progeny of Esau, a man God hated from the womb. 

Why this unaccountable vacuum of understanding when abundant information from Biblical and 
secular historians, including many Jewish authoritative sources like the ones above, are available? 
AUTHORS NOTE: If you want a true history of the world, you will have to get a set of history books 
written before about . After that the Jews took over all the major pring and publishing 
companies, and history was rewritten to suit the Zionist Jews ans. A set of  th edition Encyclopedia 

Britannica pred about  is worth more than $. Dollars if you can find a set. Its high 
price is only because it has so much true history, before the Jews rewrote history and bought all the 
publishing companies. 

Let`s account for the  tribes today and their location they migrated to from their Biblical homeland in 

North Africa. The Tribe of Ephraim to Great Britain. The Tribe of Manasseh to United States of 
America. Tribe of Zebulon to France. Tribe of Issachar to Finland. Tribe of Asher to Sweden. Tribe of 
Gad to Italy. Tribe of Simeon to Spain. Tribe of Naphtali to Norway. Tribe of Rubin to Holland. Tribe 
of Dan to Denmark. Tribe of Benjamin Iceland. Tribe of Judah to Germany; Not Israel! Of course they 
mixed some since then, but the main blood remains in these countries. 

Many times you will hear statements such as that made by Jerry Falwell, when he said: God has 
been good to America because we have been kind to the Jews.  Yet a little opened eyed looking around
