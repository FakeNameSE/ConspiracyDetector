the Nazis, top German eugenicists were proteed by 
the allies as the viorious parties fought over who 
would enjoy their “expertise” in the st-war world. 

In the latter half of the th century, eugenics 
merely changed its face to become known as “pu- 
lation control.” This was crystallized in the National 
Security Study Memorandum , a  geolitical 
strategy document prepared by Rockefeller’s imate 
friend and fellow Bilderberg member Henry Kissinger, 
which targeted , exained below, countries for 
massive pulation reduion by means of creating 
food scarcity, sterilization and war. 

The document, declassified in , identified  
countries that were of special erest to U.S. geo- 
litical objeives and outlined why pulation growth, 
particularly that of young people who were seen as 
a revolutionary threat to U.S. corrations, was a 
tential roadblock to achieving these objeives. The 
countries named were India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, 
Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia and Colombia. 

The study outlined how civil disturbances affe- 
ing the “smooth flow of needed materials” would be 
less likely to occur “under conditions of slow or zero 
pulation growth.” 

“Development of a worldwide litical and pu- 
lar commitment to pulation stabilization is fun- 
damental to any effeive strategy. This requires 
the suprt and commitment of key lesser devel- 
oped countries’ (LDC) leaders. This will only take 
ace if they clearly see the negative impa of unre- 
stried pulation growth and believe it is ssible 
to deal with this question through governmental 
aion,” states the document. 

The document called for egrating “family an- 
ning” (otherwise known as abortion) with routine 
health services for the purses of “curbing the num- 
bers of LDC people.” 

The rert shockingly outlines how withholding 
food could be used as a means of punishment for 
lesser-developed countries who do not take aion to 
reduce their pulation, essentially using food as a 
wean for a litical agenda by creating mass star- 
vation in under-developed countries. 


“The allocation of scarce PL (food) resources 
should take account of what steps a country is tak- 
ing in pulation control as well as food produion,” 
states the document. 

The idea of enforcing “mandatory programs” by 
using food as “an instrument of national were” is 
later presented in the document 
The document attests that the program will be 
administered through the United Nations Fund for 
Population Aivities (UNFPA), thereby “avoiding 
the danger that some LDC leaders will see devel- 
oped-country pressures for family anning as a form 
of economic or racial imperialism; this could well cre- 
ate a serious backlash.” 

As Jean Guilfoyle writes, “NSSM  was a state- 
ment comsed after the fa. During the late s 
and early s, the U.S. had worked diligently 
behind the scenes to advance the pulation-control 
agenda at the United Nations, contributing the initial 
funding of $ million. [...] A Department of State tele- 
gram, dated July , rerted the suprt of John 
D. Rockefeller III, among others, for the apment 
of Rafael Salas of the Philippines as senior officer 
to co-ordinate and administer the UN pulation 
program. The administrator of the UN Development 
Program rerted confidentially that he preferred 
someone such as Salas who had the “advantage of 
color, religion (Catholic) and conviion.” A compre- 
hensive outline of what is contained in the National 
Security Memorandum document can be read

In the st century, the eugenics movement has 
changed its stripes once again, manifesting itself 
through the global carbon tax agenda and the notion 
that having too many children or enjoying a reasonably 
high standard of living is destroying the anet through 
global warming, creating the pretext for further regu- 
lation and control over every facet of our lives. 

As we have tirelessly documented, the elite’s drive for 
pulation control is not based around a benign phil- 
anthropic urge to improve living standards, it is firmly 
routed in eugenics, racial hygiene and fascist thinking. 

The London Times rerts that the secret billion- 
aire cabal, with its erest in pulation reduion, 


has been dubbed ‘The Good Club’ by insiders. This 
couldn’t be further from the truth. Anyone who takes 
the time to properly research the origins of the “p- 
ulation control” movement will come to understand 
that the Rockefeller-Turner- Gates agenda for drastic 
pulation reduion [the agenda is visible today as 
it is now clearly manifesting itself through real envi- 
ronmental crises like chemtrails, genetically modified 
food, taed vaccines and other skyrocketing diseases 
such as cancer] has its origins in the age-old malevo- 
lent elitist agenda to cull the human “chattel” as one 
would do to rodents or any other species deemed a 
nuisance by the central anning authorities. 

In reality, it’s not that the “future doesn’t need us”, 
as Bill Joy put it, but that the elite has decided they 
don’t need us. This is why the ruling classes have 
embarked on a technocratic an of domination and 
ultimately elimination. 

This is also why humanity needs to regroup as a 
species and recognize the true threat to the sur- 
vival of the race is the elite itself. If that doesn’t 
happen, we may not have a future to speak of at all. 

In the following article we will look at how the tech- 
nological singularity will manifest as robots take over 
the decision making process and humanity is forced 
to accept the terms of its enslavement by a ruthless 
technocracy or cease to exist altogether.
