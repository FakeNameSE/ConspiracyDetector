of the FRB as erest on their phony money, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER 
TAXES WHAT SO EVER, and the country would not be in debt to the eight super-rich Zionist 
ernational banking families who create this money out of thin air, then demand erest on it. 

CITIZEN CONTROL 

If the Federal Congress failed to a, or aed wrongly, in the supy of money, the citizens would 
use the ballot or recall petitions; to reace those who prevented corre aion, with others whom the 
people believe would pursue a better money licy. Since the creation of money and its issuance in 
sufficient quantity would be one of the few funions of Congress, the voter could decide on a candidate, 
by his stand on money, instead of the hundreds of lesser, and deliberately confusing, subjes which are 
presented to us to day. And since money is and would remain, a national funion, local differences or

local faions, would not be able to sway the people from the nation`s (citizen`s) erest. All other 
problems, except the nation`s defense, would be taken care of, in the State, Country, or City governments 
where they are best handled and most easily correed. 

An adequate national defense would be provided by the same citizen-controlled Congress, and 
there would be no Zionist Bankers behind the scenes, bribing liticians, who are giving SHundreds of 
billions of American military equipment to other nations, disarming us, while alien nations prepare to 
attack, and invade the United States of America.

CHAPTER  

CONTROLLED NEWS MEDIA AND INFORMATION 

These Zionist agents control the information available to our people. They manipulate public 
opinion, ele whom they will, locally and nationally, and never exse the crooked money system. 
They promote school bonds, municipal bonds, expensive and detrimental farm programs, urban 
renewal, foreign aid, and many other schemes which will put the people more o debt to the Bankers. 
Thoughtful citizens wonder why billions are spent on one program, and billions on another which may 
duicate it, or even nullify it, such as paying some farmers not to raise crops, while at the same time 
building dams or canals to igate more farm land. Crazy or stupid I ask? Neither! The goal is more 
debt. Thousands of government-snsored ways to waste money go on continually. Most make no 
sense, but they are never exsed for what they really are, builders of BILLIONS FOR THE 
BANKERS AND DEBTS FOR THE PEOPLE. 

So-called economic experts write syndicated columns in hundreds of news papers, crafty 
designed to prevent the people from learning, the sime truth about our money system. Commentators 
on radio and TV, preachers, educators, and liticians blame the people, as wasteful, lazy, or spend- 
thrift, and blame the workers and consumers for the increase in debts, and the inflation of prices, when 
they know the cause is the debt-money system it self. Our people are literally drowned in charges, and 
counter-charges designed to confuse them, and keep them from understanding, the unconstitutional and 
evil money-system that is so efficiently and silently robbing the farmers, the workers, and the 
businessmen, of the fruits of their labors and of their freedoms. 

When some few Patriotic people, or organizations who know the tmth, begin to exse the more 
they try to stop any of their mad schemes, they are ridiculed and smeared as right-wiring extremists, 
super patriots, ultra-rightists, bigots,, racists, even fascists and anti-Semites. Any name is 
used which will cause them to shut up, or will at least stop other people from listening to the warning 
they are giving. Articles and books such as you are now reading, are kept out of schools, libraries, and 
book stores because the Jews own all the pring establishments and book distributing companies. The 
only way a book that tells the tmth about Zionism or the Zionism can be pred is in some back room. 

Some, who are especially vocal in their exsure, of the treason against our people, are harassed 
by the government agencies such as the EPA, OSHA, the IRS, and the rest of the Alphabet soup from 
Hell and others, causing them financial loss or bankruptcy. Using the above methods, they have been 
cometely successful, in preventing most Americans from learning the things you have read in this 
book. However, in spite of their control of information, they realize many citizens are learning the tmth. 
Therefore, to prevent violence or armed resistance to their under of America, they an to register all 
firearms and then eventually to disarm all citizens. They an to eliminate most guns, except those in 
the hands of their government lice and army. An armed citizen is a free man, and an unarmed citizen 
is a subje. Think about it! 

TELL THE PEOPLE 

The almost hidden conspirators in litics, religion, education, entertainment, and the news 
media are working for a Zionist Banker-owned United States, in a Zionist Banker-owned world, under a 
Zionist Banker-owned World Government! 

Love of Country, compassion for your Race, and concern for your children should make you 
deey erested in this, America`s greatest problem, for our generation has not suffered as much under 
the yoke of the taxes causing slavery, as the coming generation will. Usury and taxes will continue to 
take a larger and larger part of the annual earnings, of the people and put them o the ckets of the 
Bankers and their litical Agents. Increasing government regulations will prevent citizen protest, and 
opsition, to their control. It is more than ssible that your grandchildren will own neither home nor 
car, but will live in government-owned apartments and ride to work in government-owned buses.

(Both paying usury to the Bankers), AND BE ALLOWED TO KEEP JUST ENOUGH OF THEIR 
EARNINGS TO BUY A MINIMUM OF FOOD AND CLOTHING as the or people in China, 
the Philippines, South and Central American countries do today, while their Rulers wallow in 
luxury? 

In Asia and Eastern Europe, it`s called communism; in America it is called Democracy, and 
Capitalism. Communism is not dead, they just changed its name to Democracy. America will not 
shake off her banker-controlled diatorship, as long as the general public, remain ignorant of the 
hidden controllers. Zionist International financiers, who control most of the governments of the world`s 
nations, and most sources of information, seem to have us cometely within their grasp. They are afraid 
of only one thing: an awakened Patriotic Citizenry, armed with Guns, the tmth, and with a trust in 
Almighty God for deliverance. This Book has given you the tmth about their iniquitous system. What 
you do with it is in your hands, as in the hands of Divine Providence. "The fear of man bringath a snare; 
but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe. "(Proverbs :).

Chapter  

LET`S GET A COMPLETE AUDIT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM? 

BETTER YET PUT THE BASTARDS OUT OF BUSINESS, ONCE AND FOR ALL! 

The Federal Reserve has never been audited by the government, since it took over our money and 
credit in . In  a bill, H.R. , to require an audit was roduced in Congress. 

During the April,  hearings, a friend of mine submitted a statement favoring the audit, as did 
many others. It is repred on the next two pages from page - of the  pages of testimony 
given during those hearings before the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, of the Committee 
on Banking, Currency, and Housing, House of Representatives. Due to pressure form the money- 
controllers, it was not passed. No comete audit has ever been made. 

Statement of Pastor SHELDON EMRY, PHOENIX, ARIZ 

Mr. Chairman, honorable members of the Committee, I am a minister of the Gospel, with some 
years of experience in business before entering the ministry. I believe most of you men have had some 
business experience, and I know you are Ministers, for my Bible says, in Romans , that the civil rulers 
are the ministers of God to thee for good. Paul continues in verse  that the rulers are the 
minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath un him that doeth evil. 

During the last years, you men have been increasingly emoyed in studying and trying to solve 
an array of problems, many of which are called evils, and all of which have to do with money and 
economics. Although we do not all agree on the exa definition, or on their effe on the total economy, 
we are becoming increasingly familiar with such terms as currency, money, coin, credit, borrowing, 
securities, circulation, bonds, debt, erest, usury, mortgages, inflation, deflation, recession, depression, 
imundments, foreclosure, and another score of terms which enter any discussion of the American 
monetary system or American economics.
