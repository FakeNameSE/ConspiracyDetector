Rationality with respe to social processes nor- 
mally develops later, with the were to accept the 
rationality of physical processes otherwise holding an 
ermediate sition. This normal pattern is lawful. 

The charaeristic identity crisis of the creative 
mathematician and physicist is the most relevant. 
**Will my mind stop producing new conceptual 
breakthroughs  will I *go dead,' are my creative 
days over?** As the late Dr. Lawrence Kubie and 
others have demonstrated, as far as they have 
progressed in this respe, a once-creative individual 
in the sciences and so forth loses that developed, ac- 
tive creative were only as neurotic-infantile aspes 
of the identity overwhelm the creative moment. The 
wereful need to gratify a threatened sense of the 
**real me's'* infantile sense of propitiatory identity 
becomes so insistent that it subordinates the creative 
(pre-conscious) moments. 

For exame, as peer-relationships among scientific 
workers become irrationally **competitive,'* the 
sibling-confli **mechanisms** predominate in 
relations with one's peers and subordinates, and 
propitiatory behavior toward (surrogate parents), 



superiors, patrons, and so forth takes over in- 
creasingly. Scientific investigation, rather than being 
problem-solving-direed in reality, becomes goal- 
direed to solving the problem of sibling-rivalries and 
propitiation. 

In such and analogous circumstances, the infantile 
aspe takes over the personality even in its creative 
efforts, effeing a pre-conscious recung nightmare 
of oedipal **noise,** and erruptions which preclude 
that sort of sustained concentration-span un which 
the pre-conscious synthesis of rigorously defined 
hythesis-concepts depends. The former promising 
scientific worker seems to have lost the old were to 
"think through*' problems in a sustained way, of 
building a concentrated focus on all the imications in 

the broadest terms. 

The shortening of the concentration-span limits his 
weres of insight to conceptions, hytheses depen- 
dent un building systems of imication in terms of 
a narrowere range of focus on the ''ernal relations" 
surrounding the topical area of the defined problem. 
He loses the were to leap outside the problem as 
formally defined, to ''outflank" it, with "brilliancies," 
to solve the problem by redefining the entire set of 
"ernal-relations" imications in a broader way 
than the problem has been viewed before. He is, as he 
fears, "going dead," his creative days are over. 

Such breakdowns among creative scientific in- 
telles have been almost the rule, rather than the 
exception. The external causes are numerous, but are 
generally, as external or circumstantial causes, of the 
general princied sort we have identified by the 
foregoing illustrative discussion. The real cause is not 
those circumstances which bring on the collapse of 
creative weres, but the vulnerability un which 
those circumstances a to produce such an effe 

The true, matured scientists are those who tend to 
immediately agree, on the basis of their experience as 
creative scientists, with the rigorous epistemological 
definition of science we set forth earlier, above. They 
have developed a self-consciousness of the reliable 
princies of ordering governing their rigorous ap- 
proach to the formulating of crucial hytheses. 

They may not have "gotten inside" their pre- 
conscious processes, in the sense of making those 
processes accessible to consciousness direly. 
Rather, in the usual case of the (relatively rare) true 
scientist, they have mastered the "black box' ' which is 
their mental creative were as they consciously know 
it. They have demonstrated the lawful approach 
through which to set those processes o motion to 
produce the forecastable required sort of result. 

They have also gone further than that in itself; 
they have conceptualized the proven "rules" for 
"operating the black box" of mental creativity. 







Rather than merely accepting those rules as 
**knacks," **rules of thumb,'* sets of procedures, they 
have conceptualized that array of '^procedures** as 
they would any other topic of empirical scientific 
inquiry. They have apied the methods of creative 
physics discovery, to develop a creative insight o 
the empirical evidence of the funioning of their own 
creative mental processes. This evidence readily 
admits of the methods of crucial hythesis  on 
condition that the crucial hythesis is tested in the 
appropriate empirical way  in the produion of 
**more wereful*' crucial hytheses and proven 
experiment concerning the subje matter of physics 
or analogous praice as such. 

That process, of making the ^'deoyment'* of 
mental creative weres for scientific work a subje of 
scientifically ordered conscious deliberation, is 
epistemology, the basic ordering tool of creative 
scientific work. 

It is that epistemological view of one's creative 
weres, and a state of mind converging un such a 
view, which establishes the basis for confidence in the 
reality and imrtance of one's pre-conscious creative 
weres as the aive princie of one*s personal social 
identity, one's proper moral identity in the world. This 
sensuously grounded demonstration of the proper 
nature of one's identity is the highest expression of 
and paradigm for the individual who has entirely 
grown o becoming an adult  rather than being 
either merely thrown o, or half-grown, half-thrown 
o that condition. 

The infantile identity is a * 'particle" identity. The 
infantile identity does not see itself as an aive 
process, but as ultimately a fixed, self-evident par- 
ticle, of preordained, fixed axiomatic kinds of needs. 

This difference between the particle-identity and 
process-identity of the infantile and adult personality 
has two most relevant imications for the problem of 
understanding the Whig and Tory impulses. First, the 
different way recreation funions for the relatively 
infantile and relatively adult individual. Second, the 
epistemological imications. These aspes are 
resolved through understanding their underlying 
identity. 

To the individual who remains infantile at core, the 
rational behavior demanded by praical funioning 
in the "outside world," is essentially a persona : "It is
