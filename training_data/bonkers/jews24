Every new loan puts the same process in operation. Each borrowere adds a small sum to the total 
money supy, when he borrows, but the payments on the loan (because of erest), then dedu a much 
LARGER sum from the total money supy. 

There is therefore no way all debtors can pay off the money-lenders. As they pay the principal 
and erest, the money in circulation disappears. All they can do is struggle against each other, 
borrowing more and more from the money-lenders each generation. The money-lenders (Bankers), who 
produce nothing of value, slowly, then more rapidly, gain a death grip on the land, buildings, and present 
and future earnings of the whole working pulation with more debt. Proverbs : has come to pass in 
America. The borroweres have became the servants of the lenders. No wonder God Almighty forbids erest 
on loans and puts a death penalty on usury. 

SMALL LOANS DO THE SAME THING BUT MUCH WORSE! 

If you haven`t quite grasped the impa of the above, let us consider a small auto loan for  years 
at % erest. Step : Citizen borrows $, and pays it o circulation (it goes to the dealer, faory, 
miner, etc.), and signs a note agreeing to pay the Banker $,. Step : Citizen pays $ per month of 
his earnings to the Banker. In  years he will by paying the erest take OUT of circulation $, more 
than he put IN circulation.

Every loan of Banker created money (credit) Credit Card Money causes the same thing to 
happen. Since this has happened millions of times since  (and continuous today), you can see why 
America has gone from a prosperous, debt-free nation to a debt-ridden nation where praically every 
home, farm and business is paying usury-tribute to some Banker. The YEARLY INTEREST usury- 
tribute to the Bankers on personal, local. State and Federal debt totals more than the combined 
earnings and produs produced, by ALL of the working people in the country. This is why the 
national debt increases every year. 

THIS IS WHY BANKERS PROSPER IN GOOD TIMES OR BAD 

In the millions of transaions made each year like those above, little anually currency does not 
change hands, nor is it necessary that it do so.  % of all cash transaions in the U.S. are by check, 
so that Banker is perfely safe in creating that so-called loan by writing the check or desit slip, 
not against aual money, but AGAINST YOUR PROMISE TO PAY IT BACK! The cost to him is 
paper, ink and a few dollars in salaries and office costs for each transaion. It is check-kiting on an 
enormous scale. The profits increase rapidly, year after year. 

WHAT IS THE COST TO YOU? EVENTUALLY, EVERYTHING! 

In  the U.S. Federal debt was only $ billion, or $. per citizen. State and local debts 
were praically non-existent. 

By , after only  years of Federal Reserve shenanigans, the Federal debt had jumped to $ 
billion, or $ per person. 

Inl the Federal debt reached $ billion, or $, per citizen and $tate and local debts were 
mushrooming. 

Byl the Federal debt passed $ trillion and was growing exnentially as the Banker` tried 
the erest rates. $tate and local debts are now MORE than the Federal debt and with business and 
personal debts totaled over  trillion,  times the value of all land and buildings in America. 

If we signed over to the money-lenders all of America we would still owe them  more Americas 
(us their usury, of course!) 

However, they are too cunning to take title to everything. They will instead leave you with some 
illusion of ownership so you and your children will continue to work and pay the Bankers more of your 
earning so ever-increasing debts. The establishment has captured our people with their ungodly system 
of usury and debt or slavery as certainly as if they had marched in with a uniformed army. 

To understand it really is a conquest, go back to the front and read the Three Types of 
Conquest again. 

FOR THE GAMBLERS AMONG MY READERS 
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS 

To grasp the truth that periodic withdrawal of money, through erest payments will inexorably 
transfer all wealth in the nation to the receiver of erest, imagine your self in a ker or dice game 
where everyone must buy the chips (the medium of exchange), from a banker, who does not risk chips 
in the game, but watches the table and every hour reaches in and takesl% to % of all the chips on the 
table. As the game goes on, the amount of chips in the ssession of each ayer will go up and down 
with his luck. However, the TOTAL number of chips available to ay the game (carry on trade and 
business) will decrease rapidly. 

The game will get low on chips, and some will run out. If they are to continue to ay they must 
buy or borrow them from the banker. The banker will sell (lend) them ONLY if the ayer signs a 
mortgage agreeing to give the banker some real property (car, home, farm, business, etc.) if he 
cannot make periodic payments to pay back all of the chips us some EXTRA ones (erest). The 
payments must be made on time, whether he wins (makes a profit) or not. 

It is easy to see that no matter how skillfully the ay, eventually the banker will end up with all 
of his original chips back, and except for the very best ayers, the rest, if they stay in long enough, will

lose to the banker their homes, their farms, their businesses, perhaps even their cars, watches, rings, 
and the shirts off their backs! 

Our real-life situation is MUCH WORSE than any ker game. In a ker game none is forced 
to go o debt, and anyone can quit at any time and keep whatever he still has. But in real life, even if 
we borrow little ourselves from the Bankers, the local, State, and Federal governments borrow billions in 
our name, squander it, then confiscate our earnings from us and pay it back to the Bankers with erest. 
We are forced to ay the game, and none can leave except by death. We pay as long as we live, and our 
children pay after we die. If we cannot pay, the same government sends the lice to take our property 
and give it to the Bankers. The Bankers risk nothing in the game; they just colle their percentage and 
win it all. In Las Vegas and at other gambling centers, all games are rigged to pay the owner a 
percentage, and they rake in millions. The Zionist Federal Reserve Bankers game is also rigged, and it 
pays off in trillions! 

In recent years Bankers added real cards to their game. Credit cards are promoted as a 
convenience and a great boon to trade. Aually, they are ingenious devices which Bankers colle % to 
% of every retail sale from the seller and % erest from buyers. A real stacked deck! And if you 
don`t pay on time the erest is raised to %. 

YES, IT`S POLITICAL, TOO! 

Democrat, Republican, and Independent voters who have wondered why, liticians always 
spend more tax money than they take in, should now see the reason. When they begin to study our 
debt-money system, they soon realize that these liticians are not the agents of the people, but are the 
agents of the Bankers, for whom they an ways to ace the people further in debt. It takes only a little 
imagination to see that if our Congress, instead of the Bankers had been creating, and spending or 
issuing o circulation the necessary increase in the money supy, THERE WOULD BE NO 
NATIONAL DEBT, and the over $s of Trillions of other debts Government and private, would be 
praically non-existent. Since there would be no ORIGINAL cost of money except pring, and no 
CONTINUING costs such as erest, Federal taxes would be almost nil. Money, once in circulation, 
would remain there, and go on serving its purse as a medium of exchange for generation after 
generation and century after century, just as coins do now, with NO payments to the Bankers 
whatever! 


MOUNTING DEBTS AND WARS 

But instead of peace and debt-free prosperity, we have ever-mounting debt and periodic wars. 
We as a people are now ruled by a system of Banker-owned Mammon that has usurped the mantle of 
government, disguised itself as our legitimate government, and set about to pauperize and control our 
people as slaves. It is now a centralized, all-wereful litical apparatus whose main purses are 
promoting war, spending the peoples` money, and propagandizing through the news media to 
perpetuate itself in were. Our two large litical parties have become its servants, the various 
departments of government, its spending agencies, and the privately Zionist owned Internal Revenue 
Service Corration, its colleion agency. 

Unknown to the people, it operates in close cooperation with similar apparent uses in other 
nations, which are also disguised as governments. Some, we are told, are friends. Some, we are told, 
are enemies. Enemies are built up through ernational manipulations and used to frighten the 
American people o going billions of dollars more o debt to the Bankers for military preparedness, 
foreign aid to stop communism, minority rights. Citizens deliberately confused by brainwashing 
propaganda, watch helessly while our liticians give our food, goods, and money to Banker-control 
and led alien governments under the guise of better relations and easing tensions. What good are 
friends if you have to buy them?
