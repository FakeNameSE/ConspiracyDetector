never question their wild claims or their aions. 

Well I am not afraid. I refuse to be imated. When some one attempts to take what I have, my 
freedom, to enslave me, or perhaps to even kill me, he is my enemy and I will not call him a friend or 
one of God`s Chosen people!

Question: If God can have a chosen people, is it ssible that he could have people he 
dislikes or hates like the Bible in Rom. : and Mai. : says about ESAU and his descendents the 
Edomites and Canaanites` who want to control every one else? 

In the Northwestern States of America the goofy Zionist snsored Environmentalists` have 
started the very large Canadian wolves which were never native to this country, which have multiied to 
thousands, a wolf which is not a native to America. They in just  or  years have destroyed Most of the 
Elk and thousands of deer herds and wild turkeys which will all soon become extin if these Canadian 
wolves are not killed off soon, yet they rigidly enforce the laws against killing these teble wolves, who 
are killing thousands of cattle and sheep too. When I was a boy I remember listening to the radio about 
how they paid bounties for the ears of the American wolf that was doing so much damage to wild life and 
farmers near Yellowstone park in Montana. Environmentalists have no brains and can`t think! 

Those who profess to be environmentalists today are our enemies! They have little to do with 
proteing the environment or wild life, but every thing to do with taking control of land and other 
property. When you control the land, you control the food producing capability, and where one can live 
you will control the people as well. That is their an, to control people, to return us to a meager 
existence, a life style of the  th century peasant. I have always considered myself a conservationist, but 
I do not want to be called an environmentalist, because those who now control the movement, and are 
using it to promote world socialism and communism, have given environmentalism a bad name. 

They may tag me as anti- environmental, but no matter what they call me, it will not stop me from 
fighting them, to restore the traditional freedom in America, we had when I was a young man and to 
stave off the movement towards one world government. I will never give up the fight, to restore liberty 
to the American people, liberty and freedom that has been virtually destroyed, in my life time by those 
promoting today`s version of environmentalism. In my life I have anted over , trees, and 
developed  of the most beautiful parks, developed farms, built churches, and many other things for the 
good of mankind. I will leave the world a better ace when I pass on! 

If you love freedom, and you love your country, do not let them imidate you, do not be afraid 
to  your finger, at the real enemy of mankind, and the Zionist bankers who finance them. Name 
them so all the world to know who they are, and what they stand for! SOCIALISM AND WORLD 
DOMINATION!!! 


WHAT FAMIOUS MEN HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE JEWS 
FRANCO, FRANCISCO. th c. Spanish statesman. In his viory speech in Madrid, on May , , he 
declared: Let us be under no illusion. The Jewish spirit, which was resnsible for the alliance of large-scale 
capital with Marxism and was the driving force behind so many anti- Spanish revolutionary agreements, will not 
be got rid of in a day. 

PRIMP DE RIVERA. JQSE. th c. Spanish litician. His speeches stressed the Jewishness of Karl Marx and 
of the ensuing false form of socialism that took his name. 

REDONDO.ONESIMQ. th c. Spanish litical reformer (assassinated by the Communists). He stressed that the 
instruments of Jewish domination in the modern world are money and the press, and that communism is an 
instrument of ernational Jewish capitalism used to smash and afterwards rule the nations. (El Estado Nacional) 

H. H. BEAMISH, in a New York address, Oober - November ,  

"In  the word "anti-Semitic" was invented by the Jews to prevent the use of the word "Jew". The right word 
for them is "Jew" 

I imore all of you to be accurate - call them Jews. There is no need to be delicate on this Jewish question. 
You must face them in this country. The Jew should be satisfied here. I was here forty-seven years ago; your doors 
were thrown open to the Jews and they were free. Now he has got you absolutely by the throat - that is your 
reward."

CHAPTER  

ZIONISM ARTICLES TAKEN FROM THE 
INTERNET BELOW ARE ITNDFRTTNFD SO YOU 


CAN FIND THEM ON THE 
INTERNET. 

Zionism represents itself as a litical movement 
concerned principally with the establishment of a state in 
Palestine, a country they never before in history owned to be 
controlled by and for J ews. It began in the late th Century and 
attained its stated objeive with the creation in  of the state 
of Israel by the United Nations (at the insistence of the Zionist in 
the United States and without the agreement of existing Middle 
Eastern states). Subseguently Israel doubled the amount of 
tetory it controlled by means of its illegal occupation of the 
West Bank in the  and  wars. 

In its current form Zionism seeks to dominate all of 
Palestine and the Middle East by means of violence and the threat of violence (using weans 
manufaured and purchased with billions of dollars of "aid" supied by the United States at 
taxpayer expense) and to maximize its influence in world affairs and in world history, 
principally by means of control of the government of the USA (primarily by blackmailing its 
many corrupt liticians), at the expense of the social wellbeing not only of the Palestinians but 
of the peoples of all lands. 

Zionists claim that they have the right to ssess all land between the Nile and the 
Euphrates because (they say) this land was given to them by some entity they call "YHWH" as 
claimed in the Old Testament (Genesis :). But this would not be the first time that 
documents written by humans were used to justify land grabs. (And this "YHWH" appears, 
from accounts in the Old Testament, to be a particularly repulsive entity, vain, jealous, given to 
fits of rage and direing his followeres to massacre large civilian pulations. An entity who if he 
existed, would be guite unworthy of the devotion of anyone with a sense of justice and 
morality.) 

Zionists also lay claim to Palestine because this was tetory controlled by two J ewish 
mini- states, Judah and Samaria, until their destruion by the Romans in the IstC. CE. To 
which may be reied: If Zionist claims to a Jewish "homeland" in Palestine, based on J ewish 
occupation of that area  years ago, are accepted as valid then the claims of North American 
Indians to their former homeland (all of the United States) and the claims of Australian 
Aborigines to their former homeland (all of Australia) should also be accepted as valid, and 
those homelands returned. Not to mention the descendants of the inhabitants of countless 
mini- states which have risen and fallen over the course of thousands of years of human history. 
Zionist J ews have no more rights than anyone else. 

Zionists are not content with having acguired a state of their own in Palestine, they also 
want this state to be for-J ews- only, thus the desire and ention to expel from Israeli- 
controlled tetory all the indigenous inhabitants (a praice known as ethnic cleansing, a 
concept derived from the Nazi praice of "cleansing" areas of all J ews so that those areas are 
then J udenrein). 

The idea of transfer had accompanied the Zionist movement from its very beginnings, first 
appearing in The Jew Theodore Herzl's diary. In praice, the Zionists began executing a mini-

transfer from the time they began purchasing the land and evacuating the Arab tenants.... 
"Vanishing" the Arabs from the land lay at the heart of the Zionist dream, and was also a necessary 
condition of its existence.... With few exceptions, none of the Zionists disputed the desirability of 
forced transfer ” or its morality. ” Tom Segev, One Palestine, Comete: J ews and Arabs under the British 
Mandate, quoted at http:/ / www.thomwalker.com/ ditch/ sniecr_ concl.htm 

The Palestinians, being Arabs, are Semites and the Zionist never in history were Semites. 
By their open contempt for, and racist persecution of, the Palestinians the Zionist Israelis show 
that it is they who are the real anti-Semites, and their accusations of anti-Semitism (and the 
accusations of their American and European coreligionists) cast at all who criticize J ews or 
Israel amount to no more than blatant hycrisy. 

Some revealing Quotes from Zionists, including these: 

We came here to a country that was pulated by Arabs and we are building here a Hebrew, 
a Jewish state; instead of the Arab villages, Jewish villages were established. You even do not know 
the names of those villages, and I do not blame you because these villages no longer exist. There is
