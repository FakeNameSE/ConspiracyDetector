INDEPENDENT MEDIA STANDS 
IN FACE OF FERGUSON GUNFIRE 
WHILE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FLEES 

INFOWARS REPORTERS STAYED AND REPORTED WHILE MSNBC RAN IN FEAR 






 f  I 


W hile mainstream rerters from 
MSNBC and others ran away from 
gunfire in Ferguson, Mo., Infowars 
rerters Jakari Jackson and Joe 
Biggs stood their ground instead and 
continued rerting. 

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes in particular stopped his broad- 
cast and ran for cover after hearing gun shots last night, 
but in comete contrast, Biggs and Jackson rerted 
on the scene near the gunfire and even counted the 
shots. 

“At one  in a five minute span, I counted about  
shots,” Biggs rerted. 

In general, mainstream media rerted on the protests 
from designated “media zones” in relative safety far 
away from the protests whereas independent journal- 
ists were livestreaming straight from the front lines.

MIKE BROWN PROTESTERS ATTACK 
CHRISTMAS, MAKE KIDS CRY 

“WE WANT YOU TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE SHOPPING” 



O n the night of November th, a group of 
Mike Brown aivists took their “Black Lives 
Matter” protest to a mall in Seattle and dis- 
rupted a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. 
Marissa Johnson, a protest organizer, told 
a local television station the protest was designed to harass 
Christmas shoppers. 

“America goes where their cketbook goes, so today 
we’re blocking Black Friday,” she said. “We want you to be 
uncomfortable shopping.” 

In addition to drowning out children singing Christmas 
carols with chants of “no justice, no peace,” the protesters 
staged a “die-in” at the Westlake Center mall. They also 
blocked streets and erseions near Westlake Park. 

The protest resulted in the mall closing early and lice 
turning away shoppers. 

Protesters also tried to close down an upscale shopping 
center in downtown Seattle by chaining doors shut. 

“While I understand the hurt and frustration that our city 
has experienced in the past days, this is a city that respes 
the rule of law. I suprt the First Amendment rights of 
protestors, but violence against property or lice officers 
will not be tolerated in our city,” Mayor Ed Murr 
a statement.

FERGUSON RIOTERS LOOTED BLACK- 
OWNED BUSINESSES 



A s part of their efforts 
to obtain “justice” for 
Michael Brown, riot- 
ers resnded to the 
announcement that 
Officer Darren Wilson would not face 
charges by looting black-owned busi- 
nesses. 

One of the dozen buildings set ablaze 
by rioters was Juanita’s Fashion R Bou- 
tique, which is located at  West 
Florissant. 

Video of the incident shows the build- 
ing cometely gutted by fire as a 
number of individuals stand around 
laughing. 

A caption next to a piure of the burn- 
ing building caed by the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette reads, “Protesters take 
piures in front of the burning Juan- 


ita’s Fashion R Boutique in St. Louis, 
Mo. early today.” 

As a promotional video revealed, 
Juanita’s Fashion R Boutique is (or was 
before it was burned to the ground), 
“the largest black-owned boutique in 
St. Louis.” 

In a separate incident, Natalie DuBose 
was piured in floods of tears after her 
cake store was also targeted by looters. 
KMOV-TV rerted that “The major- 
ity of stores that were damaged or 
cometely destroyed during Monday 
night’s violent riots in Ferguson were 
minority owned.” 

Although National Guard soldiers were 
stationed outside a shopping mall, no 
cops or Guard troops were in ace to 
defend private property against looters 
and arsonists on West Florissant.

BLACKS SCREAMED "KILL THE WHITE 
PEOPLE" BEFORE BRUTAL MURDER OF 
ZEMIR BEGIC 

SHOCKING HAMMER ATTACK LINKED WITH FERGUSON RIOTS 


V ideo shot in the 
immediate after- 
math of the murder 
of Bosnian immi- 
grant Zemir Begic 
in St. Louis features a local resident 
revealing how blacks had chanted 
“fuck the white people, kill the white 
people” before the brutal hammer 
attack which took Begic’s life. 

With the mainstream media seem- 
ingly keen to keep a lid on whether 
or not the murder was racially moti- 
vated and linked to the Ferguson 
riots, this new eyewitness account is 
nothing less than exosive. 

Begic was killed in the early hours 
of the morning when a gang armed 
with hammers attacked his vehicle 
and then set un the Bosnian as he 
tried to confront them. 

Police insisted the attack was not 
racially motivated, while Begic’s 
family and other Bosnian immi- 
grants who turned up to protest 
the slaying asserted otherwise. Two 


suspes were taken o custody, while 
two others, a black teen and a Hispanic 
teen, are still on the loose. 

The clip above shows a local resident 
filming the scene from a distance as 
emergency personnel attempt to give 
Begic CPR. 

“Arrest them all, fuck this shit,” he 
states, adding, “And, of course, it’s a 
white kid, right after black people run- 
ning up and down the street yelling, ‘Eff 
the white people, kill the white people.’ 
This is what we have.” 

As we documented earlier, there are 
numerous other exames of Caucasians 
being verbally or physically assaulted by 
black Ferguson protesters for little more 
than being white. 

It appears that the demonstrations 
have taken a tragic turn for the worse, 
with Ferguson protesters taking their 
lead from the likes of Time Magazine, 
who published an article justifying vio- 
lent riots, with whites now apparently 
being targeted in retribution. 

As we rerted, innumerable Twitter 


users have also called for the murder of 
Darren Wilson and other white lice 
officers. 

Ferguson protesters have openly called 
for violence, with one telling USA Today, 
“It’s sad to say, but this is the new civil 
rights movement for our generation, 
and there will be casualties and there 
should be bloodshed.” 

Will the mainstream media rert 
on what almost certainly represents a 
brutal and unprovoked racial hate crime 
that led to the hofic murder of Zemir 
Begic, or will this incident be swept 
under the rug in order to maain the 
phony narrative that Ferguson protest- 
ers are peaceful? 

As Alex Jones exained in depth on 
his broadcast, the Ferguson protests 
have been hijacked and manipulated 
to turn blacks and whites against each 
other, neutralizing a tential unifying 
alliance between all races in facing up 
to corruption and tyranny emanating 
from the state.

WE ARE GOING TO INSPECT 






THE ISA WILL BE 
UNWRAPPING YOUR GIFTS 
THIS CHRISTMAS 

WRITTEN BY PAUL JOSEPH WATSON 


W ith holiday season 
approaching, the 
TSA is gearing up 
to fight the deadly 
threat sed by 
wrapped Christmas gifts. 

An Infowars reader out of San Fran- 
cisco sent us this image showing how 
TSA agents had unwrapped a book 
about herbs during a baggage inspec- 
tion. 

“The TSA has really gone too far. Now 
they are unwrapping our Christmas 
gifts for us,” writes the irate traveler. 
However, the TSA’s licy of unwrap- 
ping gifts is nothing new and has been 
happening for years.  
“We don’t enjoy unwrapping presents 
that aren’t for us, but if an anomaly is 
deteed inside, we’ll have to unwrap 
it in order to determine what it is so 
we can clear it for travel,” states a blog 


entry on the TSA website, which goes 
on to justify the procedure by ing 
out that one traveler comained about 
his knife set being unwrapped. How- 
ever, why a book about herbs would set 
off an alarm remains a mystery. 

“While you can bring wrapped gifts 
through the check, TSA officers 
may have to unwrap a gift to take a 
closer look inside,” states the TSA’s offi- 
cial guidelines. 

An image sted on Reddit illustrated 
how TSA agents had attempted to 
“re-wrap” a traveler’s gifts after ripping 
them open for inspeion. Their skills 
left a lot to be desired. 

Meanwhile, speculation is. mounting 
that airlines in Europe could be forced 
to ban all hand luggage during the 
Christmas season in order to combat a 
dubious Al-Qaeda ot to blow up five 
passenger jets in a terror “speacular”.

MOVE DOESN’T GO FAR ENOUGH, SAYS PRESSURE GROUP 


T he Montgomery County 
school distri in suburban 
Washington, DC has voted 
to strip Christmas from the 
school calendar after com- 
as by Muslims, who say the move 
doesn’t go far enough. 

In a - vote, Montgomery’s Board 
of Education removed references to 
Christmas, Easter, Yom Kippur and Rosh 
Hashanah from next year’s school cal- 
endar, reacing them with ambiguous 
terms such as “wer break” and “stu- 
dent holidays.” 

The decision was made after com- 
as by Muslim parents that the 
Islamic holiday of Eid wasn’t being rec- 
ognized. 

However, the school distri’s fail- 
ure to allow students time off for Eid 
prompted Saqib Ali, co-chair of Equality 
for Eid, to accuse education authorities 
of fostering inequality. 

“Equality is really what we’re looking 
for,” Ali told WTOP. “Simy saying 
we’re not going to call this Christmas, 
and we’re not going to call this Yom 
Kippur, and still closing the schools, 
that’s not equality.” 

School distri skesman Dana Tofig 
resnded by ing out that holidays 
are determined by likely absenteeism, 
not by adherence to religious commem- 
orations. 





“The absentee rate on the Eid holi- 
days, when they’ve fallen on a school 
day, haven’t been considerably higher 
or lowere than it is on any other given 
day,” said Tofig. 

School board member Michael Durso 
disagreed, asserting that schools were 
effeively closing for religious reasons, 
while suggesting it was litically incor- 
re not to also allow a day off for Eid. 

“It comes off as insensitive, and I just 
think we cannot afford to be in that 
light,” said Durso. 

Montgomery schools do offer excused 
absences for students who miss class 
due to religious holidays, meaning Mus- 
lims are not punished for staying home 
during Eid. 

“They would remove the Christian 
holidays and they would remove the 
Jewish holidays from the calendar 
before they would consider adding the 
Muslim holiday to the calendar,” com- 
ained Zainab Chaudry, also a co-chair 
of the Equality for Eid Coalition. 

According to the  census, the 
ethnic makeup of Montgomery County 
is .% non-Hispanic White, .% 
Hispanic or Latino 
.% Asian. 

“It is unclear

Posts on Twitter criticized Rucker,

The Left has truly gone insane. The song is about 
snow, not race. 

It is now racist to use the word white in any con- 
text. If allowed to spread, the irrational insanity of 
the Left will destroy America. 

How long before they demand their own Mao to

FOOD SCIENTISTS: NEW GMO 
POTATOES 'EXTREMELY WORRISOME' 


WOULD YOU EAT THE NEWLY APPROVED GENETICALLY 
MODIFIED POTATO NOW SET FOR COMMERCIAL 
PLANTING IN THE US? 


M m 

w 


Fould you eat the newly 
approved genetically modified 
tato now set for commercial 
anting in the US? Studies 
suggest that most would not 
(though you won’t even be told thanks to the lack 
of GMO labeling), and now major food scientists 
are speaking out over the reality that the Franken 
tato may come with ‘wosome’ and 
unknown consequences. 

Un breaking the news of the 
first GM tato approved by the 
U.S. Agriculture Department to 
hit your dinner table, it was quite 
clear that the last thing the safety 
commission within the department 
seems to care about is public health. 

We already have a host of genetically 
modified crops contaminating the food 
supy, such as corn (over %) and soy 
(over %). And with this genetic manip- 
ulation of our crops, we also have a host of 
studies demonstrating that Monsanto’s GMOs 
and Roundup herbicide (an egral part of these 
‘Roundup ready’ GMO crops) have been linked to: 
Infertility 
Cell toxicity 
Birth defes 

Superweeds (which have consumed 
over  million hearesof farm- 
lands) 

And much, much more. 



  ext 

GMO 


Yet the US government still thinks it’s perfely fine 
to leave Roundup-doused GMO crops unlabeled on the 
shelves of your local grocery stores, and even inside 
your child’s baby formula. It’s no wonder that scientists 
are now speaking out following the news. More and 
more, professionals in the medical and agricultural 
industry are beginning to take a stand against what 
has become the ernational issue of food contami- 
nation and manipulation  from Monsanto’s 
GMOs to the host of synthetic additives that 
we are consuming on a daily basis. 

That’s why, according to both a decent 
understanding of the issue and food 
scientists alike, we are about to face yet 
another wave of biological attack under 
the new GM tato commercialization. 
Here’s what Doug Gurian-Sherman, 
Ph.D., direor of sustainable agriculture 
and senior scientist at the Center for Food 
Safety (CFS), had to say on the issue: “We 
simy don’t know enough about RNA er- 
ference technology to determine whether GE 
crops developed with it are safe for people and the 
environment. If this is an attempt to give crop bio- 
technology a more benign face, all it has really done is 
exse the inadequacies of the U.S. regulation of GE 
crops. These approvals are riddled with holes and are 
extremely wosome... We need answeres 
to these questions before these tatoes 
are commercialized” 

Gurian-Sherman’s statements were 
further expanded un by Elizabeth 


 





“In light of the obesity crisis, there has been an imrtant 
national push to discourage children and adults from eating 
large quantities of fried foods like french fries or chips. In cre- 
ating the false illusion that fried tatoes are now healthy the 
Simot tato sends the absolute opsite message... Claims 
of health benefits by USDA and Simot are short sighted, 
misleading, and in the light of the science, could anually be 
tentially dangerous.” 

The time is now to share this information with friends, 
family, strangers, aivists, and the apathetic. As we approach 
the latest ‘genetic time bomb’ sitting within our fields, experts 
are warning that the time is now to get serious about regain- 
ing our food supy through legislation and the spreadiAg-of

GIRO-LOADED FOOD CORP TARGETS 
NATURAL FOODS FOR BEING 'UNFAIR 
COMPETITION' 

FOOD GIANT PANICS AS CONSUMERS RUN TO ORGANIC COMPANIES 


P erhaps you’ve heard of 
Unilever? The company 
sells produs under , 
brands, including Hell- 
mann’s mayonnaise Suave, 
Klondike, and TRESemme. In 
addition to donating hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to shut down 
GMO labeling, the mega-corp has 
also decided to file a lawsuit against 
an upstart vegan mayonnaise-mak- 
ing company, claiming “false adver- 
tising and unfair competition.” 

A Hellmann’s ad says: 

“At Hellmann’s, we make our may- 
onnaise with real, sime ingredients 
like good eggs, delicious vinegar and 
oils rich in omega . So it’s definitely 
a step in the right direion. Lean 
about he Real Food Proje at hell- 
manns.com.” 

However, if you take a look at this 
ingredient list and do a little deduc- 
tive reasoning, you’ll see that they 
have a reason to be nervous about a 
company who makes a healthier ver- 
sion of mayo: it’s full of soybean oil 
(mostly made from GMO soy), non-or- 
ganic eggs, likely from chickens who 
are kept in cruel circumstances, and 
made to eat GMO feed), and vinegar. 


Heinz was recently targeted for claim- 
ing its vinegar was “all natural,” when 
GMOs are less than natural. Will Unile- 
ver, the parent company of Hellmann’s, 
face similar issues? 

The Anglo-Dutch mega-conglomerate 



Unilever said the vegan company Just 
Mayo, “. . .already is stealing market 
share from Hellmann’s.” 

Oh, that is a little frustrating isn’t it - 


when people vote with their dollars 
and refuse toxic food? 

Unilever, which has also swallowed 
Ben & Jerry’s, Breyer’s, Lipton, Mrs. 
Filbert’s, Slimfast, Close-Up, Noxzema, 
Q-Tips, Vaseline, and hundreds of 
other brands o its multinational 
guzzler, argues that: 

“Hampton Creek’s materially false and 
misleading Just Mayo name, packag- 
ing, and advertising has caused and 
unless restrained will continue to 
cause great and irreparable injury to 
Unilever.” 

Unilever is seeking to reverse the new- 
found success that Hampton Creek is 
experiencing with their new mayo 
produ. The company wants Hamp- 
ton Creek to “remove all jars from 
shelves, and pay Unilever three 
times damages, us attorney’s fees.” 
Hampton Creek is also being told to 
start calling their mayo something 
else because it, “damages the entire 
produ category, which has strived 
for decades for a consistent definition 
of ‘mayonnaise’ that fits with con- 
sumer expeations.” 

The FDA, Unilever s out, defines 
mayonnaise as including an “egg-yolk 
containing ingredient.” 



 




Now Hampton Creek has had to prepare 
a countersuit, partly to determine ‘what 
makes mayo mayo.” 

Part of the legal tussle may have insti- 
gated because Hampton Creek sted on 
Facebook that it was “Beating Hellmann’s 
in taste tests,” and also sted a cartoon 
of a jar of Just Mayo with boxing gloves 
standing over a KOed jar of Hellmann’s 


and being declared “The Winner!” 
Unilever was not happy. “Hampton 
Creek’s superiority claims are false 
because they are not suprted by reli- 
able testing that refles aual consumer 
preferences.” 

It’s easy to control the market as a 
mega-corration with deep ckets.

DYSTOPIAN MOVIE 
'IDIOCRACY' 
PREDICTED AMERICA'S 
CULTURAL DOWNFALL 

MIKE JUDGE’S  CULT CLASSIC IDIOCRACY PREDICTED OUR CULTURAL 
DOWNFALL SO ACCURATELY THAT ELEMENTS OF THE DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY 
DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE ARE ALREADY MANIFESTING IN  AMERICA. 


T he ot of the film revolves 
around a U.S. Army Cor- 
ral who is seleed for 
a suspended animation 
experiment only to be for- 
gotten for  years, at which  
he re-emerges o a dystopian society 
where cultural and anti-elleualism 
dominate as a dumbed-down, irre- 
snsible and unthinking pulation 
live amongst their own trash. 

Right at the start of the film the narra- 
tor states that the most pular movie 
at this time is called “Ass” and consists 
of nothing more than video footage of 
a man’s buttocks for  minutes. 

Given that an image of Kim Kar- 
dashian’s buttocks has captured global 
attention and become a topic of er- 
national conversation, how far away 
are we from resembling a society which 
embraces the elleual bankruptcy 
depied in Idiocracy? 

Our new national obsession with butts 


isn’t the only way in which contem- 
rary America is mirroring Idiocracy. 

As Cory Dudak s out in his article, 
 Things Idiocracy Predied Would 
Happen and Sadly Already Have, 
“Some of the film’s notions of where 
we’re to end up are already on the fast 
track to becoming reality.” 

Dudak s to numerous exames 
in advertising, television, technology, 
the food industry, language and music 
which almost mirror some of the satiri- 
cal elements seen in Idiocracy. 

During an erview condued by Alex 
Jones last year, Mike Judge, the creator 
of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butt- 
Head, told Jones that many aspes of 
Idiocracy were already coming to pass. 
“I was thinking about the way evolution 
works, there’s no predators now,” said 
Judge. “So it started with that but then 
I was anually in line with my daughters 
in  at Disneyland at the teacups 
ride.... there was a woman behind me 


who had this altercation with another 
woman, they both have their kids in 
strollers and they just start going off 
‘I’m gonna kick your ass’.... I’m think- 
ing this isn’t what Disney had in mind.” 
“I was thinking so what if this movie 
 instead of everything being 
monolith and pristine and advanced, 
what if it was just like the Jerry 
Springer show and giant Wal-Marts, so 
I was thinking just take that chart from 
when it was made now and proje it 
out and see where that would go,” said 
Judge, adding, “a lot of the stuff that’s 
in there is maybe starting to happen 
now instead of  years from now.” 
Where do you think humanity is head- 
ing? Are we going to make it to the 
stars or is our future going to be held 
back by social engineers who have 
brainwashed armies of morons to think 
that staring at Kim Kardashian’s ass is a 
valuable way to spend their time?

DEFEAT OF USA FREEDOM ACT 
IS A VICTORY FOR FREEDOM 

IT WILL NOT SHOCK READERS TO HEAR THAT QUITE OFTEN LEGISLATION 
ON CAPITOL HILL IS NOT AS ADVERTISED 

WRITTEN BY RON PAUL 


I t will not shock readers to hear 
that quite often legislation on 
Capitol Hill is not as advertised. 
When Congress wants to do some- 
thing particularly objeionable, 
they tend give it a fine-sounding name. 
The PATRIOT A is perhaps the best- 
known exame. The legislation had 
been drafted well before / but was 
going nowhere. Then the / attacks 
gave it a new lease on life. Politicians 
exoited the surge in patriotism fol- 
lowing the attack to reroduce the bill 
and call it the PATRIOT A. To opse 
it at that time was, by design, to seem 
unpatriotic. 

At the time,  Democrats voted 
against the A. On the Republican side 
there were only three no votes: former 
Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), former Rep. 
Butch Otter (R-ID), and myself. 

The abuses of the Constitution in the 
PATRIOT A do not need to be fully 
recounted here, but Presidents Bush 
and Obama both claimed authority 
based on it to gut the Fourth Amend- 
ment. The PATRIOT A ushered in the 
era of warrantless wiretapping, moni- 
toring of our Internet behavior, water- 
ing down of probable cause, and much 
more. After the revelations by whis- 
tleblowere Edward Snowden, we know 
how the NSA viewed constitutional 


restras on surveillance of American 
people during the PATRIOT A period. 
After several re-authorizations of the 
PATRIOT A, including some cos- 
metic reforms, Congress last Oober 
unveiled the USA FREEDOM A. This 
was advertised as the first wholesale 
PATRIOT A Reform bill. In fa, the 
House version was watered down to 
the  of meaninglessness and the 
Senate version was not much better. 
The final straw was the bill’s extension 
of key elements of the PATRIOT A 
until . 

Fortunately, last week the USA FREE- 
DOM A was blocked from further 
consideration in the US Senate. The 
procedural vote was significant and 
imrtant, but it caused some confu- 
sion as well. While some well-meaning 
pro-privacy groups endorsed the FREE- 
DOM A as a first step to reform, some 
anti-liberty neoconservatives opsed 
the legislation because even its anemic 
reforms were unacceptable. The truth 
is, Americans should not accept one 
more extension of the PATRIOT A 
and should not endorse its continued 
dismemberment of our constitutional 
liberties. If that means some Senators 
vote with anti-liberty colleagues to kill 
the extension, we should still consider 
it a viory. 


As the PATRIOT A first faced a sunset 
in ,  had this to say in the debate 
over whether it should be re-autho- 
rized: 

“When Congress passed the Patriot A 
in the emotional aftermath of the Sep- 
tember th terrorist attacks, a sunset 
provision was inserted in the bill that 
causes certain seions to expire at the 
end of . But this begs the question: 
If these provisions are critical tools in 
the fight against terrorism, why revoke 
them after five years? Conversely, if 
these provisions violate civil liberties, 
why is it acceptable to suspend the 
Constitution for any amount of time?” 
Reform is often meant to preserve, 
not repeal bad legislation. When the 
public is strongly opsed to a partic- 
ular licy you will almost never hear 
liticians say “let’s repeal the law.” It 
is always a edge to reform the licy 
or law. The USA FREEDOM A was no 
different. 

With the failure of the FREEDOM A 
to move ahead in the Senate last week, 
several of the most egregious seions 
of the PATRIOT A are set to sunset 
next June absent a new authorization. 
Congress will no doubt be under great 
pressure to extend these measures. We 
must do our very best to make sure 
they are unsuccessful!

GRUBER'S GOOBERS: 
OBAMACARE DECEPTION 


ax? Penalty? Tax? Penalty? 

Either way, Obamacare is 
an order, a command, from 
on high. 

The whole debate hides 
the real fa: people are being coerced 
o a system that kill and maims at a 
staggeringly high level. 

No one in Congress or the White 
House brought that up during the 
process of promoting and passing the 
bill. Too hot to handle. Much too hot. 

If you have a system that is already 
killing a huge number of people, and 
you make that system bigger and 
bring millions more people under the 
same umbrella, the death toll will 
accelerate. 

The key journal paper on medical 
destruion is: Dr. Barbara Starfield, 
Journal of the American Medical 
Association, July , , “Is US 
Health Really the Best in the World?” 

Every year in the US, the medical 
system kills , people. , 
die as a result of FDA-approved 
medical drugs. The other , die 
as a result of mistreatment in hospitals. 

I use the Starfield rert because it is 
right down the middle of mainstream 
medicine. Before her death, Starfield 
was a widely respeed public health 
expert. For many years, she worked 
at the Johns Hopkins School of Public 
Health. The Journal of the American 
Medical Association is as mainstream 
and prestigious as you can get. 


I’m fully aware that independent 
researchers have pegged the death toll 
from the US medical system at a much 
higher number. But I wanted to show 
that, even in “The Club,” the statistics 
are known to be horrendous. 

Think about it. The US medical 
system kills , Americans per 
year. That adds up to . MILLION 
deaths per decade. 

Not long before her death, I 
erviewed Dr. Starfield. I asked her 
whether anyone from the federal 
government had ever asked her to 
consult, to help fix the medical system. 
Her answere was a stark No. 

I asked her whether she was aware of 
any significant government program 
direed at fixing the system. Again, 
she answered: No. 

Try this fiional analogy. You work 
for the government in auto safety. 
You know two things. Every tenth car 
in America contains a fatal flaw that 
will cause a crash at speeds in excess 
of mph. And, as a result of new 
legislation lowereing the driving age, 
millions more Americans will be on 
the road. What would you do? 

US litics lives and thrives on PR, 
and PR makes its money from empty 
generalizations and promises. In the 
medical arena, it’s all about “better 
care for all,” “humane concern for 
everyone,” “breakthroughs coming 
soon,” “money for more research,” etc. 

This has nothing to do with the 


aual effes of the system. It has 
nothing to do with reality. 

Well, here is the reality. By the most 
conservative estimate, the US medical 
system kills ,, people per 
decade. 

That’s the system that’s heading for 
massive expansion under Obamacare. 

You have a choice. You can go with 
the empty PR, or you can face the fas 
and realize what’s going to happen. 

“Well,” some people have told me, 
“the liticians in charge don’t really 
understand what the medical system 
is doing to people. It’s just ignorance. 
Their hearts are in the right ace.” 

And that matters? That argument 
has nothing to do with ongoing death 
stemming from standard medical 
praice. 

The death statistics I’m citing in this 
article aren’t a state secret. 

Doors chopping off women’s breasts 
for no reason. Medical drugs putting 
people o the grave. Vaccines causing 
neurological damage. Psychiatric 
drugs blasting brains and pushing 
people over o suicide and murder. . . 
no problem. The liticians’ hearts are 
in the right ace. 

Walk through a cemetery and try 
that defense. 

Tax? Penalty? Tax? Penalty? 

I just did the math. The US medical 
system killed  people while I was 
writing this article. 



 




“This bill was written in a tortured way to 
make sure CBO did not score the mandate 
as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as 



taxes, the bill dies... LlJf you had a law 
which said that healthy people are going to 
pay in - you made exicit healthy people 
pay in and sick people get money, it would 
not have passed... Lack of transparency 
is a huge litical advantage. And 
basically, call it the stupidity of the 
American voter or whatever, but 
basically that was really really critical for 
the thing to pass... Look, I wish Mark was 
right that we could make it all transparent,

GRUBER OBAMA'S 
TOP EXPERT IN  
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 


GRUBER VISITED OBAMA’S OFFICE AS THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY’S “MOST INFLUENTIAL HEALTH-CARE EXPERT” 


M IT professor Jonathan 
Gruber served as the 
key health care consul- 
tant to Obama’s  
presidential campaign 
and even visited Obama’s office to sell 
the idea of the “individual mandate,” 
which Obama later championed, 
according to a  news article. 

Gruber, who said Obamacare passed 
due to the “stupidity of the American 
voters” and their “lack of economic 
understanding,” was described by the 
Washington Post as the Democratic 
Party’s “most influential health-care 
expert” who “consulted with the three 
leading Democratic campaigns about 
their health ans,” including Barack 
Obama’s. 

He pressured the Obama campaign 
to suprt the “individual mandate” he 
helped developed for Massachusetts’ 
state-run health care, which forced 
people to buy insurance or face a pen- 
alty. 

“Gruber championed this idea in 
Massachusetts, and ... he did the same 
in Obama’s office, on the phone with 


[John] Edwards and in conversations 
with Chris Jennings, Hillary Clon’s 
health licy guru,” rerter Perry 
Bacon Jr. wrote, adding that Gruber had 
to warm up the Obama campaign to the 
idea of the mandate. 

He told Obama’s advisers that a man- 
date was necessary. 

“[Gruber] said that without (sic) the 
mandate, Obama’s an would shrink 
the number of uninsured from  per- 
cent to  percent,” Bacon rerted. 
“Obama’s aides said that they think they 
could achieve universal care without a 
mandate, but that they would add one 
if they did not.” 

Yet Obama has been attempting to 
downay Gruber’s role in Obamacare 
after Gruber was caught on video dis- 
aying his disdain for American voters. 

The president even claimed that 
Gruber was “some adviser who never 
worked on our staff,” but it’s quite obvi- 
ous that Gruber had undue influence in 
shaping not only Obamacare but also 
Obama’s overall health care licies. 

Obama even admitted this in  
when he mentioned Gruber as one of 


the “brightest minds from academia and 
licy circles” he had “stolen ideas from 
liberally.” 

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi 
also made reference to Gruber repeat- 
edly while campaigning for Obamacare 
in late , but she tried to claim she 
didn’t know who he was in the after- 
math of the Gruber videos. 

Steven Rattner, a former Obama 
administration adviser, told MSNBC 
host Joe Scarborough that Gruber was 
“the guru on health care” and that he 
“was certainly viewed as an imrtant 
figure in helping to put Obamacare 
together.” 

“I think if you go back and look at the 
Washington Post or the New York Times 
or anything from that period, you will 
find Jonathan Gruber’s name all over 
it, as both someone who’s the leading 
expert on health care quoted by every- 
body, and as someone who the White 
House was using,” Rattner said. 

And the Washington Post’s  arti- 
cle proves Rattner right. 


 




WRITTEN BY KURT NIMMO 


OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE 
ACTION WILL FINISH OFF 
AMERICA 


ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF UNILATERAL AMNESTY WILL BE A DEATH BLOW 


O bama’s unconstitutional 
executive aion “to 
shield millions of undoc- 
umented immigrants/’ 
as The New York Times 
puts it, is a brazen effort to further 
imverish the American middle class 
and convert the country o a third 
world wasteland. 

This reality is ignored by the corrate 
media as it celebrates Obama’s “land- 
mark” betrayal of the Constitution. 

The establishment media fails to  
out the obvious: the federal government 
has merged a huge underclass o the 
system, specifically the tax system. 

Details were spelled out by Neil Munro 
of The Daily Caller on Thursday. He 
noted that the legalization of illegals 
will imse further financial obligations 
on American taxpayers. 

“Illegal immigrants will receive huge 
payments from American taxpayers 
under rules now being imsed by 
President Barack Obama’s unilateral 


amnesty,” Munro writes. 

He s out statements by Cecilia 
Munoz, a former immigration lobbyist 
who is now a top Obama aide. Munoz 
admitted millions of imverished and 
near imverished Mexican immigrants 
will become part of the tax system. 

Munro cites a study showing that  
percent of legal and illegal immigrants 
and their children are classified as living 
in verty or in near-verty. 

Once these immigrants are enrolled in 
the tax system, Munro notes, they will 
be entitled to Earned Income Tax Credit 
payments. “A family with two kids, and 
an income of $,, would receive 
$, in taxpayer funds this year 
alone,” he writes. 

This huge transfer of wealth from 
produive Americans to a parasitical 
class of verty-stricken immigrants 
will hasten the economic demise of the 
nation. 

Prior to the legalization of illegal 
immigrants, % of Americans received 


some sort of transfer payment from 
the government: Social Security, food 
stamps, the Women, Infants and Chil- 
dren program, unemoyment, sub- 
sidized housing, railroad retirement, 
veterans’ benefits, etc. 

Obamacare is further exacerbating 
the situation. “This law is going to 
financially cripe millions of American 
families. It truly is a death panel for the 
U.S. economy,” writes Michael Snyder. 

Add to this the $ trillion given to 
“too big to fail” banks, and you have 
a situation that will soon result in eco- 
nomic collapse. 

The situation is not happenstance or 
due to government bungling and inepti- 
tude. It is part of a carefully orchestrated 
an to loot the remaining wealth of the 
country and destroy the middle class. 

Obama’s unconstitutional executive 
aion will imrt Mexico’s litical and 
economic system o the United States 
 a tiny financial elite lording over mil- 
lions of desperately or campesinos. 


OHIS HUGE TRANSFER OFWEAHH

SURVEY: AMERICANS HAVE 
SMARTENED UP TO MASS 
GOVERNMENT SPYING 


% ARE CONCERNED ABOUT NSA SURVEILLANCE 


r new survey from Pew finds 
that a huge majority 
of Americans are now 
extremely wary of govern- 
ment spying, with % 
saying they are concerned about the NSA 
aively monitoring their communications. 

The ll found that the large majority either 
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement 
that ‘Americans should be concerned about 
the government  s monitoring of phone calls 
and Internet communications.  

In the survey of over  people, more 
than % said that they knew “a lot  
about “the government colleing infor- 
mation about telephone calls, emails, 
and other online communications as 
part of efforts to monitor terrorist aiv- 
ity,  While a further % said that they 
had heard at least something about 
it.More Americans than ever are aware 
that their government has been and still 
is spying on them. 

Resndents were most concerned 
about government monitoring their 
social media aivities. Over % of 
social media users said they were at 
least somewhat concerned about the 
NSA having access to the social media 
content, while % said they were 
“very concerned  about this facet of 


government spying. 

In addition, % of adults in the 
survey “agree  or “strongly agree  that 
consumers have lost control over how 
personal information is colleed and 
used by companies such as Google and 
Facebook. 

While a recent separate ll found 
that Americans seemed more wary of 
Google and Facebook than they were of 
the NSA, this latest Pew ll indicates 
that Americans are just as concerned 
about how their own government is 
taking advantage of such communica- 
tions companies for surveillance. 

In addition, a previous survey by 
Pew found that % of Americans said 
they were willing to discuss NSA spying 
in person, while less than half that 
figure, only %, were willing to make 
their opinions known online, for fear 
of being aced on some government 
watch list or worse. 

“One of the most notable findings in 
the study is that those who have heard 
the most about government surveil- 
lance are more privacy-sensitive across 
an array of questions in the survey,  
Mary Madden, senior researcher at the 
Pew Research Center said. 

“Those who are more aware of the 


monitoring programs feel considerably 
less secure using any communications 
channel to share private information.  
she added. 

The legislation is being pushed by 
Senate elligence committee head 
Dianne Feinstein, who has said there 
should be “privacy compromises  in 
order to get it passed.With the opening 
of the st-eleion “lame-duck  session 
this week, there are fears that the now 
GOP controlled Senate will attempt 
to sneak through a “cybersecurity  
bill, already passed in the House, that 
would “create a massive loophole in 
our existing privacy laws,  according to 
theACLU. 

The Obama Administration has previ- 
ously said that it ended to veto such 
legislation. However, the White House 
also recently stated that an “informa- 
tion sharing  cybersecurity bill, rather 
than reform of the NSA, was a priority. 

The FBI is also currently lobbying to 
force the likes of Google and Facebook 
to insert backdoors o email and chat 
programs. 

It seems that while Americans have 
become wary of government spying, it 
is not going away any time soon unless 
further aion is demanded.

ERIC GARNER: KILLED 
BY POLICE FOR TAX 
EVASION 

COP CHOKED GARNER TO DEATH FOR SELLING 
UNTAXED CIGARETTES 


T he Grand Jury decision not 
to indi an NYPD officer for 
choking Eric Garner to death 
is a shocking travesty of 
justice, but why were lice 
harassing Garner in the first ace? 

The answere; He violated New York 
City’s ridiculous cigarette tax laws. Eric 
Garner was summarily executed for 
avoiding taxes. 

Garner was tackled by several cops and 
put in an illegal chokehold by Officer 
Daniel Pantaleo during an incident in 
Staten Island earlier this summer. Video 
footage clearly shows that Garner was 
not resisting arrest and was not aing 
aggressively towards the officers. The 
-year-old father of six begged for his 
life, telling officers he couldn’t breathe, 
before dying moments later in what the 
medical examiner’s office ruled a homi- 
cide caused by the chokehold. 

Garner was choked to death for the 
crime of selling untaxed cigarettes, 


so-called “loosies”. His fatal encounter 
with the NYPD would not even have 
occurred if not for New York’s punitively 
insane cigarette tax, which levies an 
additional state tax of $. per pack in 
addition to a further city tax of $. 
per pack, driving an underground econ- 
omy which accounts for over half of all 
cigarettes consumed in New York State. 

Cigarette smuggling has increased  
per cent since  in resnse to a  
percent hike in cigarette tax during that 
same period. 

“Garner chose to participate in the 
booming underground cigarette market 
as a smuggler. Since , he had been 
arrested eight times for selling loosies, 
which are pular among people who 
can’t afford a full pack because of the 
excessive taxes,” writes Lawrence J. 
McQuillan, noting that NYPD chief 
Philip Banks issued an order to crack 
down on vendors of smuggled cigarettes 
just days before Garner died. 


In November , Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg signed a bill which increased 
“enforcement on vendors who attempt 
to evade taxes.” 

“These events confirm that lice are 
ultimately the enforcers of the tax code, 
and every vote for higher taxes gives 
lice increased authority to exert more 
force on citizens in more situations. 
Higher excise taxes inevitably lead to 
more violent clashes between lice and 
smugglers,” concludes McQuillan. 

The resnsibility for Garner’s death 
should not be shifted away from Officer 
Daniel Pantaleo, who clearly should 
have been put on trial for manslaughter, 
but the entire situation would not have 
arose in the first ace if not for New 
York’s obsession with high taxes. 

Many reaed to the non-indiment 
on Twitter by refeng to the tax issue.

ERIC GARNER'S DAUGHTER: 
'THIS IS NOT A BLACK AND 
WHITE ISSUE' 

DAUGHTER OF BLACK MAN KILLED BY POLICE REFUTES NOTION 
THAT RACE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH FATHER’S DEATH 


S peaking with CNN’s Don 
Lemon following the grand 
jury decision not to indi 
the officer resnsible 
for Garner’s death, Erica 
Garner said she felt the issue was a 
microcosm of the larger problem of 
lice brutality, which has come to 
affe virtually all walks of life equally. 

“This is not a black and white issue,” 
Garner told Lemon. “This is a national 
crisis. Like... I believe this is a crisis.” 
Garner added that she felt a sense 
of solidarity with people of different 
cultures after she saw the amount 
of suprt her family received from 
around the world: 

“I mean for White people to come 
out and show how deey they was 
hurt, and like Asians and, you know, 
different people from different nations 
and different parts of the world to 
come out and show that they felt the 
same way I felt on that video, I greatly 


appreciate it. It’s like a sense of I’m not 
the only one that feels this way.” 

Garner even stood her ground after a 
determined Lemon attempted to have 
her ay to the racial narrative. 

“Are you saying this is not an issue 
of race? I’m sure... You think this is a 
racial issue?” Lemon again asked. 

“I really doubt it. It was about the 
officer’s pride. It was about my father 
being ’ and  unds and he 
wants to be the top cop that brings a 
big man down,” Garner answered. 

Garner’s opinion greatly differs from 
protesters who are aively embracing 
the push to conflate the issue of lice 
brutality with racism. 

The race issue was revived after a 
Missouri grand jury declined to indi 
a Ferguson lice officer who shot and 
killed black teen Michael Brown. 

Garner’s case, however, was different 
from Brown’s in that publicly available 
video footage clearly showed lice 


strangle a non-violent illegal cigarette 
vendor to death. 

“This young lady is absolutely 
right,” writes the Young Cons’ Michael 
Cantrell. “What transpired between 
NYPD and Eric Garner wasn’t about 
the color of his skin. It’s about whether 
or not a lice officer was using exces- 
sive force when it wasn’t necessary.” 

“Garner’s daughter is right on the 
money about this being a critical issue 
facing the nation. There have been 
many stories in the news about law 
enforcement stepping over the line 
of appropriate aion, and the viims 
have been folks of all races,” Cantrell 
writes. 

It certainly is refreshing to see that 
people on the inside of the issue aren’t 
falling for the race-baiting taics of 
Rev. A Sharpton or the race war insti- 
gating corrate media. 


THE DAUGHTER OF ERIC GARNER, THE MAN CHOKED TO 
DEATH LAST JULY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE CRIME OF 
SELLING LOOSE CIGARETTES, REVEALED TO CNN THAT 
SHE DID NOT CONSIDER RACE TO BE A FACTOR LEADING 
TO HER FATHER'S MURDER.

NATO AND RUSSIA 
MOVE CLOSER TO WAR 

NATO ENCOURAGES RUSSIA’S NEIGHBORS 
TO ARM REGIME IN KIEV 


T he new NATO boss, 

Jens Stoltenberg, has 
announced the creation of 
an “erim spearhead” in 
resnse to recent Russian 
military aivity following the crisis 
in Ukraine. 

According to an Associated Press 
rert, the move is in reaion to 
“Russia’s aggressive aions in neigh- 
boring Ukraine.” 

“We are proteing our allies and 
suprting our partners,” Stolten- 
berg said. 

Stoltenberg is the former prime 
minister of Norway. Following his 
apment in March, he said the 
Russian “invasion” of Ukraine was a 
“brutal reminder of the necessity of 
NATO.” 

The reaion force will consist of 
troops from from Germany, the Neth- 
erlands and Norway and will be in a 
constant state of readiness, according 
to Stoltenberg. The erim force will 
become permanent in . 

In Early September NATO decided 


during a meeting in Wales to deoy 
troops in Estonia, Lithuania and 
Latvia. The countries share a common 
border with Russia and Belarus. 

In addition to rotating troops out of 
states bordering Russia, NATO ans 
increased air patrols over the Baltic 
Sea. 

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 
endorsed the provocative move. He 
urged NATO foreign ministers to 
contribute their “fair share” to the 
alliance and said “we can’t have st 
century security on the cheap.” 

According to the German newspa- 
per Deutsche Welle, Stoltenberg said 
that while NATO will not provide 
war material to the government in 
Ukraine, it will urge NATO member 
states to do so on a bilateral basis. 

Tass, the Russian news agency, 
rerts a NATO decision to provide 
funds ended to reform and mod- 
ernize the Ukrainian army in logis- 
tics, command and control, cyber 
defense, military medicine and reha- 
bilitation of the injured. 


On Tuesday, the commander of U.S. 
Army Europe said he looks forward to 
adding  Abrams tanks and Brad- 
ley Fighting Vehicles to the forces in 
Poland and the Baltic states. 

In resnse to the NATO announce- 
ment, Alexander Grushko, the Rus- 
sian NATO ambassador, said the 
decision to exacerbate the situation 
in Ukraine is a change for the worse 
in the region. He said increasing mili- 
tary aivity “will lead to serious risks 
of military incidents.” 

“NATO is doing all this under the 
guise of the so-called ‘Russian threat.’ 
Our relation to these measures is 
well-known: this region of the world 
has seen no serious military and 
litical changes and such steps don’t 
fit in the logics of building relations 
in the defense sphere on the new 
basis,” Grushko said.

  SIGNS THAT RUSSIA 
IS PREPARING TO FIGHT 
(AND WIN) A NUCLEAR 
WAR WITH THE UNITED 
STATES 

IF THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA FOUGHT A NUCLEAR 
WAR, WHO WOULD WIN? YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BY 
THE ANSWER 



nder the Obama administra- 
tion, the rapidly aging U.S. 
strategic nuclear arsenal 
has been shrinking. Mean- 
L,tyhile, the Russians have 
.Seen developing an entirely 
^new generation of bombers, 
submarines and missiles that have the 
capability of delivering an absolutely 
criping first strike. At this , most 
Americans consider a full-scale nuclear 
war to be inconceivable. But in Russia 
attitudes are cometely different. To 
the Russians, the United States is enemy 
number one these days and the Russians 
are feverishly preparing for a tential 
military showdown. Of course the 
Russians don’t anually want to have to 
resort to nuclear war. Such an event 
would be an unspeakable horror for the 
entire globe. But if one does happen, 
the Russians want to make sure that 
they are the ones that come out on top. 

A lot of Americans are still operating 
under the faulty assumption that the 


dorine of “mutually assured destruc- 
tion” still apies. The thinking was that 
both sides had so many nuclear missiles 
that a launch by one side would guaran- 
tee the destruion of both parties. 

But since that time, so much has 
changed. For one, the U.S. nuclear arse- 
nal is far, far smaller than it was back 
then. Back in , the U.S. military 
ssessed more than , strategic 
nuclear warheads. Now, we only have 
, deoyed, and that number is 
scheduled to be further reduced to 
about ,. 

Sadly, reducing the size of our nuclear 
arsenal by close to  percent is not 
enough for anti-nuke crusader Barack 
Obama. He has sken of unilaterally 
reducing the size of our strategic nuclear 
arsenal down to just  warheads. 

During this same time period, the 
Russians have been developing some 
very impressive stealth delivery sys- 
tems which have the capability of 
hitting targets inside the United States 


within just minutes of an order being 
issued. This is particularly true of their 
submarine-launched missiles. The 
newest Russian subs have the ability to 
approach our coastlines without us even 
knowing that they are there. If the Rus- 
sians came to the conclusion that war 
with the United States was unavoidable, 
an overwhelming first strike using sub- 
marine-based missiles could tentially 
take out nearly our entire arsenal before 
we even knew what hit us. And if the 
Russians have an anti-ballistic missile 
system that can ercept the limited 
number of rockets that we can launch 
in return, they may be able to escape 
relatively unscathed. 

In order for “mutually assured destruc- 
tion” to work, we have to see the Russian 
missiles coming and have enough time 
to order a launch of our own. Thank 
to emerging technologies, the balance 
of were has fundamentally shifted. 
The old way of thinking simy does not 
apy anymore and the Russians under- 


 



stand this. 

The following are  signs that Russia 
is preparing to fight (and win) a nuclear 
war with the United States... 

Russia is spending an 
enormous amount of 
money to develop the 
PAR DA Strategic Bomber. 
Not a lot is known about 
this stealth bomber at 
this time. The following 
summary of what we do know comes 
from an Australian news source... 

Russia’s answere to the B- “Spirit”, 
this next-generation strategic bomber 
is ended to be almost invisible to 
radarand capable of carrying a huge 
array of conventional and nuclear 
missiles. Little else is known other 
than its expeed service date: . 

Russian nuclear 
bombers have been 
regularly buzzing areas 
in northern Europe 
and along the coast of 
Alaska. The Russians 
' ’ appear to be brazenly 

testing NATO defenses. Here is just 
one recent exame... 

Russian strategic nuclear bombers 
caed out air defense zone incur- 
sions near Alaska and across Northern 
Europe this week in the latest nuclear 
saber rattling by Moscow. 

Six Russian aircraft, including two 
Bear H nuclear bombers, two MiG- 
fighter jets and two IL- refueling 
tankers were ercepted by F- 
fighters on Wednesday west and north 
of Alaska in air defense identification 
zones, said Navy Capt. Jeff A. Davis, 
a skesman for the U.S. Northern 
Command and North American Aero- 
space Defense Command. Two other 
Bears were ercepted by Canadian 
jets on Thursday. 

Russian Defense Minis- 
ter Sergei Shoigu says that 
Russian nuclear bombers 



will now condu regular patrols 
“in the western Atlantic and eastern 
Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and 
! I the Gulf of Mexico  . 

 £ Russia is construing an 

Mm anti-ballistic missile system 

which will supsedly be 
 superior to anything that the 

il U.S. currently has. . . 

Currently under development, the 
S- missile is ended to be capa- 
ble of ercepting ercontinental 
ballistic missiles when combined with 
radar input from the likes of the new 
A-  AWACS aircraft. It is supsed 
to be able to track and shoot at up to 
 supersonic targets at any one time 
at heights of up to km. 

Russia recently successfully 
test launched a new subma- 
rine-based ercontinental 
ballistic missile... 

A Russian Northern Fleet 
nuclear submarine on 
Wednesday fired a test ercontinen- 
tal missile from the Barents Sea to the 
country’s far eastern Kura Range on 
the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Russian 
Defense Ministry said in a statement 
Wednesday. 

“Within the frameworks of testing the 
reliability of marine strategic nuclear 
forces, the Tula [nuclear submarine] 
launched a Sineva ercontinental 
ballistic missile from the Barents Sea 
to the Kura Range [in Kamchatka],” 
the statement says. 

The RSM- ercontinental ballis- 
tic missile Sineva (NATO code name 
SS-N- Skiff) is part of the D-RM 
launch system. 

The D-RM launch system equipped 
with RSM- missiles was put o 
service in . The produion of the 
RSM- was halted in  but after 
three years, the Russian government 
resumed the produion of a modern- 
ized version of the missile.

Ivw^ Russia already s- 

.$£<sesses super silent 

nuclear attack subma- 
rines that arevirtually 
' ' ‘ undeteable when 

submerged. In a previ- 
ous article, I discussed 
how the U.S. Navy refers to these 
virtually undeteable subs as “black 
holes".. . 

Did you know that Russia is build- 
ing submarines that are so quiet that 
the U.S. military cannot dete them? 
These “black hole” submarines can 
freely approach the coastlines of the 
United States without fear of being 
deteed whenever they want. In 
fa, a “nuclear-wered attack sub- 
marine armed with long-range cruise 
missiles” sailed around in the Gulf 
of Mexico for several weeks without 
being deteed back in . And 
now Russia is launching a new class 
of subs that have “advanced stealth 
technology”. The U.S. Navy openly 
acknowledges that they cannot track 
these subs when they are submerged. 
That means that the Russians are able 
to sail right up to our coastlines and 
launch nukes whenever they want. 

 Russian media outlets 
are rerting that  
percent of all Russian 
nuclear missiles will 
have radar-evading 
capability by . . . 
Russia’s Defense Minis- 
try ans to comete the rearmament 
of Strategic Missile Forces within six 
years. “By , the share of new 
missile systems will reach nearly 
%, and by  their share will 
increase to %. At the same time the 
troop and wean command systems, 
combat equipment will be qualita- 
tively improved, first of all  their 


capabilities for the suppression of 
antimissile defense will be built up,” 
Defense Ministry’s RVSN skesman 
Colonel Igor Yegorov told ITAR-TASS 
on Friday. 

For the first time 
ever, Russia has 
more strategic 
nuclear warheads- 
deoyed than the 
United States does... 

For the first time, Russia, which is in 
the midst of a major strategic nuclear 
modernization, has more deoyed 
nuclear warheads than the United 
States, according to the latest numbers 
released by the State Department. 

Russia now has , warheads 
deoyed on ercontinental ballistic 
missiles, submarine-launched ballis- 
tic missiles and heavy bombers. The 
United States has ,, said the fa 
sheet released Wednesday. 

The warhead count for the Russians, 
based the Sept.  rert required 
under the  New Strategic Arms 
Reduion Treaty (START), shows an 
increase of  warheads since the 
last declaration on March . The U.S. 
rerted a warhead increase of  
during the same period. It is not clear 
why the warhead numbers increased. 

Russia has a massive 
advantage over the 
United States and 
NATO when it comes 
to taical nuclear 
weans... 

As for taical nuclear weans, the 
superiority of modern-day Russia over 
NATO is even stronger. 

The Americans are well aware of 
this. They were convinced before that 
Russia would never rise again. Now 
it’s too late. 




To date, NATO countries have only 
 taical nuclear weans in the 
ETO. The United States has  
bombs with a total capacity of  
megatons. They are located on six air 
bases in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the 
Netherlands and Turkey. France has 
 more atomic bombs. That is pretty 
much it. Russia, according to conser- 
vative estimates, has , pieces 
of different classes of TNW - from 
Iskander warheads to torpedo, aerial 
and artillery warheads! The US has 
 taical B- bombs on its own 
tetory, but this does not change the 
situation against the backdrop of such 
imbalance. 

W Russian President 
Vladimir Putin has 
initiated a huge 
:i “weans modern- 
ization program” 
that is projeed to cost the equivalent 
of  billion dollars... 

Putin said Russia’s weans modern- 
ization program for - should 
focus on building a new array of 
offensive weans to provide a “guar- 
anteed nuclear deterrent;” re-arming 
strategic and long-range aviation; 
creating an aerospace defense system 
and developing high-precision con- 
ventional weans. 

He would not elaborate on pro- 
speive weans, but he and other 
officials have repeatedly boasted 
about new Russian nuclear missiles’ 
capability to penetrate any prospec- 
tive missile shield. 

The Kremlin has bolstered defense 
spending in the past few years under 
an ambitious weans modernization 
program that runs through  and 
costs the equivalent of $ billion. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese have been 


investing heavily in this kind of tech- 
nology as well. 

In fa, just the other day the Chi- 
nese successfully tested a new sub- 
marine-launched ercontinental 
ballistic missile... 

China’s JL- second-generation 
ercontinental-range subma- 

rine-launched ballistic missile, 
which has the ability to reach the 
continental USA, is already believed 
to be deoyable by the Peoe’s 
Liberation Army, rerts Huanqiu, 
the Chinese-language website of the 
nationalistic Global Times tabloid. 

The Julang-  literally “Giant 
Wave   has reached a preliminary 
level of proficiency, according to the 
US-China Economic and Security 
Review Commission in its rert to 
US Congress on Nov. . 

Most Americans do not believe that 
any of this is a concern whatsoever. 

Most Americans just assume that 
a full-scale nuclear war is virtually 
imssible. 

But the truth is that a successful 
first strike against the United States is 
more ssible today than it ever has 
been before. 

Hopefully the American people will 
wake up to this reality before it is too 
late.
