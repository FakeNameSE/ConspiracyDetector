dollars or Marks in just  years from  to . The best way of demonstrating this kind of 
inflation is with Postage stamps although everything else went up in comparison. 

This Inflation was brought about by the same Jewish Zionist Banking Families, who own the 
Federal Reserve Bank in the U. S. A. Who deliberately caused this Hyper Inflationary period of 
 to  to get comete control of Germany, AND THEY DID for a while ? It teaches what the 
same world bankers, who own the Federal Reserve Bank, can and have done to different nations many 
times in history, and is taking ace in America now. It is making slaves of everyone through I.R.S. 
TAXATION to pay the Bankers INTEREST (Usury) on the money they create from thin air. All they 
can think about is raising taxes, which will put us further in to Slavery. I can't show a true piure of 
inflation with cups of coffee, sacks of tatoes, loves of bread or Mercedes Benz Automobiles, but 
Postage stamps tell the story of inflation very well. These stamps represent the inflationary cost of 
mailing a letter from  to  in Germany. Every thing else went up in prortion. 

In  Stamps were equal to about two cents (two pfennigs) and rose in value so fast they 
couldn't pr new stamps or money fast enough, so they hand stamped new figures over smaller existing 
stamps, just to keep up. I have a colleion of  pages of these stamps with about  stamps on each 
page. 

. The first page goes from . cents or Pfennigs each to $. each. 

 The second page goes from $. to $. Each. 

. The third page goes from $.. To $,. 

. The forth page goes from $,. To $,,,. just to mail a letter. 

. The inflation was so bad the faory workers wives had to go to the faories at noon to pick up 
their husband's wages for the morning, because if they waited until evening the money was almost 
worthless. They had to spend it all twice a day. No one wanted to keep money even overnight because it 
went down in value so fast. 

If a man had one million dollars hard earned money, in the bank at the beginning of this 
inflation , and left it in the bank, at the end of four years he would have had the aual 
purchasing were of l/,th (one twenty five thousandths) of one cent. Everyone spent all the 


Page  of  



money he received, for who but a fool would save money, when it was worth less every hour? All 
savings, pensions, stocks etc. were totally lost or stolen by the bankers, as they an to do in America 
soon. 

We must remember the same Zionist banking families that own the Federal Reserve Bank, in the 
United States today, owned the Reich Bank in Germany years ago. The bankers got greedy as they 
always do, and the money depreciated from inflation, to where the price of a stage stamp went from 
about  cents to ,,,. Marks, the equivalent of $,,,. in just four years,  
to . FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS JUST TO MAIL A LETTER! This contrary to what the 
controlled news media tells us today is what brought Hitler to were. Someone had to end this financial 
tyranny by the bankers, who in four years ended up owning literally everything in Germany. Even farms 
and faories which had been in the same families for generations back, ended up as bank property 
through foreclosures, and the people mistakenly blamed the local bankers instead of the central banks, 
belonging to the International Bankers. 

A farmer after selling everything he could produce one year could not buy seed for the next year, 
without going in debt to the Bankers for it. Farms, homes and faories, which had been in the same 
family for generations back, were lost to the bankers. The faory owners were in the same fix, all they 
could produce one week, wouldn't pay wages to the workers, and much less buy the raw material, for the 
next week. The farms, faories, mines and all industry ended up, belonging to the Zionist Jewish 
bankers in a short time. Then the people had to work for the bankers, who owned everything, for a 
pittance or just whatever they could get, or be unemoyed. This is what brought Hitler to were. 
Someone had to end this tyranny by the bankers and he did by taking it back from the bankers. He was a 
German Hero! 

Now think about this a minute, lets get this in prospeive, your mind can't comprehend figures 
like fifty billion dollars, or marks to mail a letter, when four years before, it had been two cents ( 
pfennigs). 

They still tell the true story in Germany today of a thrifty Contraor that had saved up the 
colossal sum of ,. marks (about $,. dollars) in . The inflation started, and he 
could not figure out what to do with his money to prote it from inflation. So he left it in the bank 
drawing erest. Then one day about two or three years o the inflation, he got a letter from the bank, 
with a check for his ,. in it. There was also a letter with it telling him, that keeping his 
account open was no longer profitable for him or the bank. Here is your money, to do as you ease 
with it On the envelope was a $,,. Mark stage stamp. Just think what this did to all 
savings, stocks, bonds, insurance licies in Germany. It`s coming in America soon. Think about the 
I.R.A.s people have put their savings in. And there will be civil war, and blood in the streets everywhere, 
when the siled people of America`s pay checks become worthless or stop coming, and their money and 
savings are wiped out with inflation. 

The ernet and there are hundreds of books out that will tell you the same true story I am telling 

you. 

At the height of the inflation period, prices rose not only daily but hourly. The story is told of a 
German who ordered a steak dinner, priced at ,. Marks, while it was cooking the price rose to 
,. Marks, and before he could eat it and pay the bill, the price was ,. Marks, Peoe went 
shopping with market baskets full of bills. 

The same International bankers initially financed Hitler and his rise to were. However after 
achieving were, Hitler double-crossed the International bankers and instituted a debt-free or  erest 
free money system . This enabled Germany to go from being an imverished nation to becoming the 
most wereful military nation on Earth, in less than five years. The same bankers then made loans to 
finance both sides of the war and financed the destruion of Hitler, by financing both sides of the war, 
just as they are financing the destruion of the Arab nations today, because the Arab nations are the only 


Page  of  



nations left on earth, who have debt-free growing economies based on real wealth, from their oil 
produion. This debt-free money is the biggest threat on earth to the International bankers who create 
money out of thin air (O.T.A.), and charge erest (usury) for the use of it every year, and never create 
the money to pay the erest with, so now we have runaway inflation in the U.S.A. and worldwide. 

In  the bankers increased the inflation rate in Germany to %, in  it reached % 
over the pre War level, and by Oober , when the currency became worthless, IT WAS  
BILLION PERCENT % OVER THE PRE WAR LEVEL. Think what destruion this did to a 
country, when they lost not only their homes, farms, business, faories and all the people's savings, 
insurance licies, stocks, bonds, pension funds and mortgages owned by the real German people, who 
like the Americans of today, are kept in ignorance. They knew something is wrong, but don't know 
exaly what, and don't know how to fight it. THE INFLATION IN GERMANY WAS MISNAMED. 
IT WAS NOT A GERMAN INFLATION, IT WAS A PRIVATE BANKERS, MONEY ISSUE 
INFLATION, PERPETRATED BY INTERNATIONAL ZIONIST SCHEMERS. IN OUR 
COUNTRY, WE WOULD CALL IT THE FED. OR THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, A 
SELF SERVING ZIONIST CONTROLLED PRIVATE BANK. 

THINK ABOUT THIS; TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE 

The price of an ape, has always been about the same as the price of a stamp, to mail a letter, 
today about . cents. At two cents each, fifty billion dollars or marks would buy ,,,, 
apes. That's two and one half trillion apes. This is enough apes to build a HIGHWAY three 
thousand miles long from coast to coast across the United States, and that road would be two miles 
wide, (solid apes, each three inches in diameter)! The price of a stamp had risen from two cents (.), 
to fifty billion marks or dollars (,,,. marks), just to mail a letter in only  years. What 
will Gasoline cost then? 

Today the ernational bankers are doing the same thing again, to all the countries in the world. 
Through usury and inflation, all the nations except the Arab Nations, are in debt to these ernational 
bankers more than their net worth. Our national, state, county, and city, governments have mortgaged all 
our land, houses and everything we own to these bankers, and edged to pay it back with taxes, colleed 
from us slaves, our children and grandchildren. ONLY A DAMN FOOL OR AN 
UNSALVAGEABLE IDIOT WOULD SAY WE LIVE IN A FREE COUNTRY TODAY. We have 
lost our personal freedoms, along with our national freedoms. Our God-given freedoms were lost, 
because of this ungodly usury system, the bankers made available to us, also the Congress of the United 
States, was bribed o turning over our money system, to them inl. This is the same year the 
Internal Revenue Service w as started, solely to colle the money, to pay the erest to the private 
bankers, on the money they create out of thin air. What is the Constitutional definition of a Dollar? A 
true dollar is a given weight, of Gold or Silver or a U.S. paper dollar that was redeemable in Gold or 
Silver. 

What is the definition of a note? A note is an erest bearing debt . A note is the same 
thing you sign at the bank, when you borrow money from them. The erest is paid to the eight private 
Zionist Jewish banking families, who own the FEDERAL RESERVE BANK (FRB), and the 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND I. M. F. World banks. With this ill gotten money they are 
buying up, the whole surface of the earth . Today what they don't own out right, they own the mortgages 
on. It is all done in secret. The name itself, Federal Reserve Bank, imies that it belongs to the U.S.
