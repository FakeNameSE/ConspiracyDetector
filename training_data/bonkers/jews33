IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR A CHURCH TO BE INCORPORATED 

I tried to exain to the Tax Assessor, that we do not have an Incorrated Church. And neither 
he nor anyone else will ever force us to do so, In other words to become a [c] [] Organization, A 
business corration. Which comes from the United States Code Title  seion  [c] [] (The 
Internal Revenue Code Book) and is mandated for all incorrated Churches, organizations, and 
foundations. 

Today while esusing the so-called dorine of separation of Church and state; our were 
hungry government, with the judges at the helm, has taken control of the incorrated Churches. This 
is done by talking the ministers o trading unalienable rights, for mere government privileges. Most 
people are too ignorant to figure out that anything the government gives they can also take back anytime 
they ease. If the Government can create a corrate Church; they can also tell the Church 
they created exaly what they can or can`t preach or teach from the BIBLE. They can fine, 
confiscate, take Church property or destroy an incorrated Church they have created as they have 
many times already. 

Did you know the vast majority of Churches in America today, aren`t GODS Churches at all? 
This is a sad but true statement. Approximately % of the Churches have let the lying lawyers, talk 
them o trading their God given unalienable rights, for corrate privilege or status, the single 
biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the Churches of America. This was done by means of Church 
incorration and the (c) () tax-exempt  business license . Incorration is by law, a type of 
business license. Before incorration a Church is  immune  from taxation or regulation by the 
government. Free Churches have the same status as sovereign governments do, and therefore, are 
not subje to the status, codes, regulations and laws of local, or federal government as long as they 
break no moral or public laws . See seion  of the IRS code cited above, where the IRS 
recognizes the (immune status of unincorrated Churches.) 

Why don`t people study? A Church that incorrates literally goes and seeks out the state (a 
lesser god, mind you), then submits itself as a subje of the state instead of a subje of the 
ALMIGHTY, then ask or begs this lesser god for permission to exist and operate. Their pastors sign 
agreements that bind them with the enemies of God. They become government agents who 
contranually swear allegiance to the state, then are not allowed to speak out for or against moral or 
immoral government licies or good or bad litical candidates, or the Income Tax and the FED. 
They can`t because of corrate law, even speak for a righteous person mnning for office, or carry a 
petition against abortion in there Church or ward. But they Trade this God given immunity, an 
immunity that even the IRS Code recognizes, for a state granted privilege. What is wrong with their 
head? 

Corrations have no constitutional rights. By law a Corration is a person created by the 
State but with no Constitutional rights. An incorrated Church has no First Amendment rights, 
nor do they have any  th amendment rights. The following is a quote from the US Supreme Court 
on incorration in the case of Hale vs. Hinkle in .

 The benefits of the  th Amendment are exclusively for a witness compelled to testify against 
himself in a criminal case, and he cannot set them up on behalf of a corration.  

Your pastor when he incorrates becomes a government agent, controlled by what ever law a 
tyrannical judge wants to hold them to. The Bible tells us we can`t have two masters at once. How can 
our Churches have two masters? Church INCORPORATION IS BLASPHEMY! 

To prove my , where were the Churches and pastors when the court (Zionist judges), banned 
prayer, Christmas, the Cross, prayer and the Bible etc. in our public schools and Government Buildings, 
but allow the Zionist Jews, to disay a giant Jewish Menorah on white house grounds? Where were they 
when the government legalized the taking of innocent human lives by sanioning abortion? What kind 
of fruit is the Church bearing, when people are not even allowed to circulate a petition against 
abortion in their Church, because the pastors and Bishops are afraid they will loose their 
damnable  (c) () tax exemption Business license status? Where did the government get the were 
to stop Churches from taking a public stand against abortion, sodomy, homosexuals, lesbianism and 
many other Bible teachings against sin? To take a stand against any of the above sins spelled out in the 
Bible, is considered by the Government a Political stand which corrations are bared from 
doing. 

THE SIN OF THE CORPORATE Church 

The Bible defines the Church as that great body, comsed of all men, women and children who 
have accepted God`s laws and who have given Him their lives to live, as He commands them, trusting 
God in All things. This then means those who have aced their faith, their life and their eternal souls in 
His hands. A Church should be those who make up the local group of believers, who meet for singing, 
rejoicing, praising and worshiping God. They help each other and the needy. 

The local Church generally starts out by having meetings in some person's home. Maybe there 
were only two individuals who met originally or two coues who were close friends, who decided one 
day to study God's Word together and pray together. 

From this usually small group, the congregation grows in numbers until the membership is too 
large to meet in a home. At this time, the group of local Bible students (house Church), begin to talk 
about becoming more organized, and forming a Church in the sense that one usually thinks of a Church; 
perhaps looking forward to the time they can have some land, their own building, (God's house), to meet 
in. 

How will we do this? What do we do now? These are the normal questions that would come to 
mind when people begin to make ans. In the minds and hearts of true Bible studying and believing 
people, all these questions are answered for them in God's Holy Word. They already know how to do 
this, and in the event there are new converts in the group, as well as there should be, the Bible is there to 
guide them. 

God knew what He was doing. They should lean on God's Word and He will show you every 
step of the way. He will even carry you when it is necessary. The  is that God, in His infinite 
Wisdom, knew exaly how His local Churches were to be set up, and He very ainly laid out His an 
in His Holy Scriptures. This an has been followed faithfully down through the years and over the 
centuries, with comete success until we let another religion, with another set of law books usurp 
and take over the were, of what was once a God fearing American Government. 

Now, all of a sudden, in just the last few years of the th century, the local Churches, their 
Church leaders, staff, and deacons decided on their own, that they knew more than God. They simy 
gave in to immoral take-over of our government by God`s age old enemies. Then conform to their 
ancient enemies laws which came straight out of Babylon. They decided to change God's Holy Plan. 
They changed the basic struure of the Church organization again, Fifty seven years ago () when 
the Internal Revenue A of  was accepted as legal sitive-law rather than exsing it as the 
unconstitutional, ungodly perversion which it really is. The Churches Incorrated themselves rather

than turn to God, for strength and guidance. They forgot the freedom given them by their Maker, His 
Word and our wonderful Constitution. They had failed to read and study The Law of the Land and, 
therefore; did not know their Rights. The worst thing they did was fail to TRUST GOD . 

ANARCHY OR FREEDOM 

What is often called anarchy, the Bible calls the Kingdom of Heaven. Independence, liberty, 
and self government are usually called anarchy by those in government. They cannot agree to anything 
that might remove them from their coveted sitions of were over the people. However, what few of 
them fail to realize is that, when the Zionist Beast (Government) falls, they are going to fall with it. 
Their worst fear (freedom for the people) will be realized. They try to label it anarchy, but it is liberty. 
To the central liticians, anarchy means any situation where central government is not in control. 
But, Scripture describes central government in less than friendly terms, and promises retribution and an 
ignominious end to the cormpt system. 

The scribes and Pharisees (or attorneys), who the Jews in their own Encyclopedias, Talmud and 
books admit; We are the Pharisees of the Bible, but Jesus lied, we are not the bad people he said 
we are. see the whole  rd chapter of Matthew for the teble things Jesus said about the Jews. Instead 
of staying away from those hycrites, the modern Churches have sought out these Lawyers, 
snakes and vipers as Jesus called them for counsel. Worse than that, they took their advice 
which was to form Church Corrations. Black's Law Diionary, Sixth Edition, defines a 
corration as; An artificial person or legal entity created by or under the authority of the laws 
of a State, An association of persons created by statue ... within the scope of the weres and 
authorities, conferred un such bodies by law. 

It should be fairly obvious, even to the casual observer that this could NOT POSSIBLY work, 
because it is a new god. A corration is under the authority, rules, regulations and laws of the State. In 
the law, words mean everything in law. Therefore, it is not a casual child's relationship. The State has 
comete dominion over all corrations. This is the law! ! There is NO other way to look at it. The 
State creates corrations. 

CORPORATIONS HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT, OF 
FREE SPEECH. The Church has voluntarily given up its Fourth Amendment Rights to Privacy 
and must submit its books and papers for examination by both the State and federal government. 
An incorrated Church is not entitled to the Rights of the Fifth Amendment either.
