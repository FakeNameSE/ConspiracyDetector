view WHITE H<y USE PETITIONS 


T he Obama administration 
said the petition, which 
urged the White House to 
take proper aion to fight 
Ebola, was removed from 
Whitehouse.gov because it “violated” 
the “Terms of Participation.” 

“The petition you are trying to access 
has been removed from the site under 
our Moderation Policy because it is in 
violation of our Terms of Participation,” 
the White House stated. “While you 
can’t sign this petition, there may be 
other petitions on We the Peoe on a 
similar issue that you’d like to add your 
name to.” 

Of course, no where in the First Amend- 
ment does it state citizens can only 
petition the government for a redress 
of grievances if they accept terms and 
conditions written by the White House. 

So, by removing the petition, it 
appears the Obama administration is 
more erested in controlling the nar- 
rative surrounding the Ebola pandemic 
than anually stopping the disease. 


For one thing, Obama refuses to ban 
travel from Ebola-struck African coun- 
tries despite Marine Gen. John Kelly 
warning the outbreak in Africa could 
lead to “mass migration o the U.S.” 
of those infeed with Ebola seeking 
treatment. 

“If it breaks out, it’s literally, ‘Katie bar 
the door,’ and there will be mass migra- 
tion o the United States,” Kelly said 
in remarks to the National Defense Uni- 
versity. “They will run away from Ebola, 
or if they suspe they are infeed, they 
will try to get to the United States for 
treatment.” 

But Obama has downayed this 
ssibility, choosing instead to make 
boastful statements, which have been 
refuted time and again by reality, that 
U.S. officials have procedures in ace to 
stop Ebola. 

“We know how to fight this disease,” 
the president claimed in a speech on 
Saturday. “We know the protocols and 
we know that when they’re followed, 
they work.”
