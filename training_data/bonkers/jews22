THREE TYPES OF CONQUEST 

History reveals nations can be conquered, by the use of one or more of three methods. 

THE FIRST AND MOST COMMON IS CONQUEST BY WAR; In time, though, this 
method usually fails, because the captives, hate the captors and rise up and drive them out, if they can. 
Much force is needed to maain control, making it expensive for the conquering nation. 

A SECOND METHOD; IS BY RELIGION, where men are convinced they must give their 
captors part of their earnings as, obedience to God. Such captivity is vulnerable to philosophical 
exsure or by overthrow by armed force, since religion by its nature lacks military force to regain 
control, once its captives become disillusioned. 

THE THIRD IS WHERE AMERICA FITS; 

THE THIRD METHOD; CAN BE CALLED ECONOMIC CONQUEST. It takes ace, 
when nations are aced under tribute, without the use of visible force or coercion, SO THAT THE 
VICTIMS DO NOT REALIZE THEY HAVE BEEN CONQUERED. Tribute is colleed from 
them in the form of legal debts and taxes, and they believe they are paying it, for their own good, for 
the good of others, or to prote all from some enemy. Their captors (the Zionist) become their 
benefaors and proteors, Like has happened here in America. 

Although this is the slowest to imse, it is often quite long-lasting, as the captives do not see any 
military force arrayed against them, their religion is left more or less a, they have freedom to speak 
and to travel, and they participate in eleions for their rulers. Without realizing it, they are conquered, 
and the instrument of their own society, are used to transfer their wealth, to their captors and make the 
conquest comete. 

In  the average American worker paid few taxes and had a little debt. Last year payments on 
debts and taxes took more than half, of what he earned. Is it ssible a form of conquest has been 
imsed on our people? Read the following pages and decide for yourself. And may God have a mercy 
on this once debt-free and great nation. 

THE REAL STORY OF THE MONEY CONTROL OVER AMERICA, THIS STUDY ON 
MONEY IS NOT COPYRIGHTED. IT MAY BE REPRODUCED IN WHOLE OR IN PART 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING THE AMERICA PEOPLE. 

Americans, living in what is called the richest nation on earth seem always to be short of money. 
Wives are working in unprecedented numbers, husbands hope for overtime hours to earn more, or take 
part-time jobs evenings and weekends, children look for odd jobs for spending money, the family debt 
climbs higher, and psychologist say one of the biggest causes of family quarrels and breakups is, 
arguments over money. Most of this trouble can be traced to our present debt-money system. 

Too few Americans realized why the Christians Statement wrote o Article I of the U.S. Constitution: 

Congress shall have the Powere to Coin Money and Regulate the Value Thereof.  

They did this, as we will show, in prayerful hope it would prevent, love of money, from 
destroying the Republic they had founded. We shall see how subversion of Article I, has brought on us 
the evil of which God`s Word had warned. 

MONEY IS MAN`S ONLY "CREATION 

Economics use the term create when speaking of the process by which, money comes o 
existence. Now, creation means making something that did not exist before. Lumbermen make boards 
from trees, workers build houses from lumber, and faories manufaure automobiles from metal, glass 
and other materials. But in all these, they did not create, they only changed existing materials o 
more usable and, therefore, more valuable form. This is not so with money. Here and here alone, man 
anually creates something out of nothing. A piece of paper of little value is pred, so that it is worth 
a piece of lumber. With different figures it can buy the automobile, or even the house. Its value has been 
created in the true meaning of the word.

MONEY ˜˜CREATING` PROFITABLE 

As is seen by the above, money is very cheap to make, and whoever does the creating of money 
in a nation can make a tremendous profit! Builders work hard to make a profit of  % above their cost to 
build a house. 

Auto makers sell their cars for % to % above the cost of manufaure, and it is considered good 
business. But money manufaurers, have no limit on their profits, since a few cents will pr a $ bill 
or a $, . Bill, and on top of that, they charge erest on it forever. 

This profit is part of our story but first let us consider another unique charaeristic of this thing 
called money, the love of which is the root of all evil. 

AN ADEQUATE MONEY SUPPLY NEEDED 
An adequate supy of money is indispensable to civilized society. We could forego many other 
things, but without money industry would grind to a halt, farms would become only self-sustaining units, 
surus food would disappear, job requiring the work of more than one man or one family would remain 
undone, shipping and large movements of goods would cease, hungry people would under and kill to 
remain alive, and all government, except family or tribe, would cease to funion. 

An overstatement, you say? Not at all, Money is the blood of civilized society, the means of all 
commercial trade except sime barter. It is the measure and the instrument by which one produ is sold 
and another purchased. Remove money or even reduce the supy, below that which is necessary to 
carry on current levels of trade, and the results are catastrophic. For an exame, we need only look at 
America`s Depression of the early  `s. 

THE BANKERS DEPRESSION OF THE `s 
In  America did not lack industrial capacity, fertile farmland, skilled and willing workers or 
industrious farm families. It had an extensive and highly efficient transrtation system in railroads, road 
networks, and inland and ocean waterways. Communications between regions and localities were the 
best in the world, utilizing telephone, teletype, radio, and a well-operated government mail system. No 
war had ravaged the cities or the countryside, no pestilence weakened the pulation, nor had famine 
stalked the land. The United States of America in  lacked only one thing: 

In the early  `s, Zionist FRB Bankers, the only source of new money and credit, deliberately refused 
loans to home town banks, industries, stores and farms. Payments on existing loans were 
required however, and money rapidly disappeared from circulation. Goods were available to be 
purchased, jobs waiting to be done, but the lack of money brought the nation to a standstill. By this 
sime oy America was put in a depression and the greedy Bankers took ssession of hundreds of 
thousands of farms, homes, and business properties, like they did in Germany in the s. The people 
were told, times are hard, and money is short. Not understanding the system, they were cruelly 
robbed by the Bankers of their earnings, their savings, and their property. 

DO BANKERS CREATE MONEY FOR PEACE? NO! 

MONEY FOR WAR? YES! ANY TIME! 

World War II ended the depression. The same Bankers who in the early `s had no loans for 
peacetime houses, food and clothing, suddenly had unlimited billions to lend for guns, ammunition, 
Army barracks, K-rations and uniforms! A nation that in  couldn`t produce food for sale suddenly 
could produce bombs to send free to Germany and Japan! (More on this riddle later.) 

With the sudden increase in money, people were hired, farms sold their produce, faories went to 
two shifts, mines re-opened, and The Great Depression was over! Some liticians were blamed for it 
and others took credit for ending it. The truth is the lack of money (caused by the Zionist bankers), 
brought on the depression, and adequate money ended it. The people were never told that sime tmth, 
and in this article we will endeavor to show how these same Bankers who control our money, and credit, 
have used their control to under America and ace us in such bondage we are going to have to fight

our way out of it. Throughout history the only way freedom once lost is ever regained is with much 
bloodshed. 

POWER TO COIN AND REGULATE MONEY 

When we can see the disastrous results of an artificially created shortage of money, we can better 
understand why our Founding Fathers, who understood both money, and God`s Laws, insisted on acing 
the were to create money, and the were to control it ONLY, in the hands of the Federal Congress. 
They believed that ALL citizens should share in the profits of its creation, and therefore the national
