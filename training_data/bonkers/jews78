MANY ARE ALREADY SEEING THE BEGINNING OF THE END with the results of drugs, 
alcohol, srts and sex softening the moral values of our society, making it easy for civil strife and anarchy to 
develop, with a background of jungle music, voodoo aivities, and hard rock music, hate propaganda on T. V. , 
murder, rape, drug use, reckless driving, vulgarity, profanity, race mixing, etc. It is not safe now in cities to walk 
down many of their streets in daylight alone, much less at night. Peoe live behind locked and bolted doors and go 
shopping in pairs or groups. Gangs control and kill in their conquered domains of the cities, and lice are no 
longer in control. It is nothing to what is coming soon. We believe these cities will become literal battlefields of 
mass murder, race riots, devastation, and fire-storms. The concentration of other races with their violent natures, 
and hatred of the Caucasians and Christians, will result in massive racial annihilation. Scriptures seem to prove 
that when people are "bunched up" great trouble abounds, for we are tetorial creatures by nature and to crowd us 
o aces tends to destroy individuality, morals, and religious princies. 

Exame: Babylon. Trouble always starts in the cities in a nation, while rural inhabitants tend to be more 
stable, serene, secure and moral. Get out of the cities while you can. When trouble starts it's too late to go to the 
country or mountains. Where do people go when trouble starts? Home of course and will, as history bears out, die 
within a block of their own home either defending their home or taking food from a neighbor. It will be "Burn 
Baby Burn" as it has in the past. 

Many of these people's ancestors have been slaves. Although this was generations back, the flames have 
been fanned by Zionist controlled modern T. V. and Hollywood movies that keep this hate built up. When the 
main question is "Where is the next meal for me and my family coming from?" they will say that anything 
they have to do to get food for their wife or children is justified, including stealing, looting, robbing, 
murdering, raping, and any other abomination they can dream of. 

My advise is to get out of the cities before they burn, buy a small farm that you can pay for 
with cash. Get out of the usury system, join together with other like-minded Israel people who believe in gathering 
together; home remedies for the sick, home schooling for the children, home birthing, midwives, herbs and natural 
food home grown, living on less and enjoying it more. Live in a shack if you have to, a shack in the

country that is free and clear of debt is better than a mansion in the city that you still 
owe money on, for which the usury or erest system bleeds you every month. 

Don't start anything with the tax people. It is a losing situation and will take so much of your time you won't be 
able to make a living and start farming at the same time. The government stomps on tax protesters so if you 
owe taxes, either pay them or file for bankruptcy and start anew, mainly by getting back to the 
land and keeping God's laws starting with the true Bible Sabbath. The Bible tells us woe to 
those that live house to house, housetop to housetop, I. E. in the cities, condos, apartment houses, subdivisions, all 
owned and financed by monolies. Keep God's Sabbath, laws and covenants and the blessing will follow. God 
promised this. We should try.

CHAPTER  

The following comes from one of about  books and Pamphlets Written by a 
Minister and good friend of mine an expert on the subje of how the Zionists have 
taken over America in hundreds of ways including the Zionist Banking system. His 
name was Lt. Col. Gordon Jack Mohr AUS Ret. Deceased. He gave me permission 
years ago to copy any of his works as long as it was to help America and the rest of 
the world. I take this information from the book called  THE ENEMY WITHIN. 
Foreword: ... While there are many authors, the subje is always the same, the subversion of the 
Christian faith and the white Christian civilization which has engendered and which in spite of all 
criticism, has done more for the people of the world than any other civilization which has ever 
existed. 


TELEGRAM TO A CONGRESSMAN 

On July , , Gerald L.K. Smith sent a lengthy telegram to Congressman Velde, retiring 
Chairman of the Congressional Committee on Un-American Aivities. (Since destroyed by the liberal 
left in Congress). Here is part of what he said: 

Dear Congressman: Your records will reveal that I was the first person to circulate a 
petition calling for the continuing suprt of your committee in the years of  and . Nearly half- 
a-million names appeared on that petition. As a fighting enemy of Communism I have assembled through 
the years a dossier concerning the conspiracy to undermine our American Way of Life and overthrow the 
government of the United States. 

I imore you to permit me to appear before your committee as you invited Bishop Bromley 
Oxnam (a Communist leaning Bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church) in order that I may put o the 
permanent record of your committee fas which can be confirmed by documented evidence. It goes 
without saying, that I take issue with Bishop Oxnam and Stand ready to produce evidence concerning his 
left wing associations thus far never presented to your committee. I would like also to present names of 
individuals of unimpeachable charaer and reputation who will be willing to testify under oath in 
confirmation of my statement, 

I am aware that the fulfillment of this request might tax the moral courage of certain members of 
your committee, but I stand ready to be cross-examined without mercy and will not attempt to shelter 
myself. The records will reveal that some years ago, I attempted to present evidence before your 
committee concerning the conspiratorial operations of Charles Chain (A Jewish- Communist movie 
aor, who is now being memorialized by IBM in their TV ads.) 

Your records will reveal that William Z. Foster, head of the Communist Party, U.S.A. testified 
before your committee that the two chief projes of their party was the destruion of Gerald L.K. Smith 
and his movement. In view of this fa, I believe the time has come for you to permit me to appear before 
your committee.
