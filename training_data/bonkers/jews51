days of so-called or self-styled Jews and are celebrated as such throughout the world. The official translation 
o English of the Kol Nidre (All Vows) Prayer Follows: 

KOL NIDRE 

"All vows, obligations, oaths, anathemas, weather called 'konam', 'konas', or by 
any other name, which we may make vow, or swear, or edge, or whereby we may be 
bound, from this Day of Atonement unto the next, (whose happy coming we await), we 
do repent. May they be deemed absolved, forgiven, annulled, and void and made of no 
effe; they shall not bind us nor have were over us. The vows shall not be reckoned 
vows; ,the obligations shall not be obligatory; nor oaths be oaths." 

Page five-a (-a) of the Alabama Journal, Montgomery, Ala., Friday, O.  th , and page one () of the 
Pensacola Journal, of Feb. , , confirm the fa that The Kol Nidre Service is still in effe among Jewish 
groups now living in the South. 

In the light of these admitted truths, what is now the status of Jewish individuals who annually take this 
religious vow? What is their true legal status in their local communities, in fraternal organizations, in lodges, in 
sworn-societies of combined memberships of Gentiles and Jews, in courts of law, in public office, or when 
registering to vote? Which oath is binding un them; their religious Kol Nidre oath or their civil oaths? 

Is Kol Nidre the deey-hidden, but real exanation for the unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious 
decision handed down since Black Monday, Mat , , by Felix Frankfurter and his Zionist Jewish-dominated 
and Rabbi-instrued Supreme Court of the united States of America? 

Does :Kol Nidre in effe say; The end justifies the means? And if so, is not this basic tenet of Jewry? 

The Author went on the ernet yesterday and typed in KOF NIDRE and in . one hundredths of a 
second, it found over , times it was mentioned, and many times in the you tube movies, with the 
Rabbi`s and, or their Congregations chanting or singing it. 

The line is being drawn between those who suprt enslavement, under total government run by 
LIARS and THIEVES, who have broken a sacred oath, to uphold that supreme law and Constitution,

while selling out to the Zionist banking system, who control the judges, lice and liticians, who have 
enslaved our once great nation. On the other side, are those who demand Liberty, Justice and Freedom. 
Government emoyees are more erested in their sition and their pensions, than sticking their neck 
out to help this country. Extremism in the name of liberty is no vice. Let us shine the light of truth on 
these vermin and watch them scurry back o the dark, like cockroaches. We have reached  the age of 
accountability  and we know we have a corrupt system in this country. It`s dangerous to be right, 
when the government is wrong. Good people are going to jail everyday, while heinous crimes in high 
aces (Ephesians :-) go unpunished, because of tyrannical judges and prosecutors, working as a 
team to keep the jurors and the accused ignorant of their rights. "My people are destroyed for lack of 
knowledge.: Hosea:. Get the Government off our backs! 

I want to help my children and grandchildren to enjoy the same freedoms for which this country 
was once famous for and was still there, when I was young. When I was y a  or  year old boy could 
take a  caliber rifle and a fishing le and go anywhere. He knew he had to behave because the 
neighbors would rert any wrongdoing to his parents. Today there are so many rules and regulations, 
that a parent is scared to even take his children hunting or fishing, for fear of being fined for some 
unknown law, passed just to enhance the government court and fine system. If we do not fight them, 
what kind of hell are we leaving for our children and grandchildren? 

Liberty and love are the only things you cannot have, unless you are willing to give it to others! 
We do not want to be lulled to sleep anymore. We are awake and angry and end to remain so. YE 
SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU MAD. Now that you are 
mad, let us fix it! Let`s get back to the "COMMON LAW courts this country was founded on, before 
this corrupt system got started, where we have justice instead of equity (admiralty courts). The law of the 
sea has come on land now. It is called Maritime law, and it is unconstitutional and un-American. I 
cannot find where the U.S. Supreme Court ever over turned the rulings of a Common Law Court or an 
Ecclesia Court (Church Court). The Bar association, has put the price of justice out of reach for 
most Americans today. The justice system at all levels, is too expensive, woefully inefficient, arrogant, 
rusive and downright dangerous. 

Thomas Jefferson once said: "Men will not appreciate the Second amendment until they have to 
fight for it Madison in Federalist paper # said: "the chief proteion we have against tyranny is to be 
armed.  I recall the Bosnians turning in their weans a few years ago and since then, there have been 
more than two million killed. They had gun confiscation in Germany, Somalia, Cuba and Haiti too. 

THE QUOTE OF THE YEAR  WAS; 

This year will go down in history. For the first time in civilized nation has full gun registration. 
Our streets will be safer, our lice more efficient; and the world will follow our lead in the future. 
Adolph Hitler () ( THE INKLING NEWS, Vol , Issue , , th St., Hawarden, IA ). Then 
what happened? 

George Washington said; "FIREARMS STAND NEXT IN IMPORTANCE TO THE U.S. 
CONSTITUTION ITSELF. THEY ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLES` LIBERTY, TEETH AND 
KEYSTONE UNDER INDEPENDENCE. TO SECURE PEACE, SECURITY AND HAPPINESS, 
THE RIFLE AND THE PISTOL ARE EQUALLY INDISPENSABLE. THE VERY ATMOSPHERE 
OF FIREARMS EVERYWHERE, RESTRAINS EVIL INTERFERENCE -THEY DESERVE A 
PLACE OF HONOR WITH ALL THAT IS GOOD. " 

The Japanese would not attack the west coast of America after Pearl Harbor, because they had 
heard the militia were guarding the coast, and the AMERICAN CITIZENS WERE ALL ARMED! 
There are over  million American homes armed with rifles, the largest standing army on earth. 
This is why the ONE WORLDER`S, the Zionist bankers are scared of us, and know they must disarm 
us in order to succeed. The world today is a much more dangerous ace than ever before. Contrary to 


Page  of  



the talking heads Ken and Barbie on the evening news; we need our arms more than ever! An old but 
true saying says; the only way liberties once lost, are ever regained, is through much bloodshed.  

Winston Churchill said in , Still, if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win 
without bloodshed, if, you will not fight when your viory will be sure and not so costly, you may have to 
fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival.  

There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chance of viory, because it 
is better to perish than to live as slaves. 

MORE GOOD QUESTIONS: If a robber, thief or other criminal holds a gun to your head, takes 
your money because he does not want to work, and uses it for a lavish lifestyle, is he your enemy? 
More than  cents out of every dollar we earn is taken from us, used to provide lavish living styles for a 
government elite or bankers, to fund thousands of things we do not approve. Of all working Americans, 
 % are emoyed by some level of government, local, state or federal and these people are afraid to 
open their mouth in opsition to the people they work for. Funds taken from us are given in huge 
amounts to foreign countries to bribe them o doing something the bankers want done. 
Government officials have become the modern day Robber Barons of the past. Are those who authorize 
the unconstitutional taking of our money and misusing it, not our enemies as surely as a robber with a 
gun. 

If a foreign nation invades our shores to conquer or enslave us, or to imse a different ideology 
or religion un us, they would be considered our enemies. When some Zionist people within our 
country attempt to do the same thing, against our will, why are they not considered our enemy, and 
why are we afraid to name them, and to call them our enemy? 

Our constitution was written to provide a basis of law, with the rights of the individual being the 
supreme law, granted by God with the idea, that whatever God Gave, man could not take away. 
Today, all of the inalienable rights granted by God are considered privileges government can revoke at 
will. Are those who would pass such laws, which take away our rights as individuals, and those who 
enforce such laws, which they know to be unconstitutional, are they not our enemies as surely as if they 
were invading conquerors? Are those who bind us with chains of legal authority any less dangerous, 
than those who ace real chains around our necks? 

Why do we fail to  our finger at those who take what we have, and seek to reduce us to 
the life style of peasants? Those who seek to destroy all the technology we have developed in the last 
 years, advances that have enabled us to create a lifestyle, envied by every nation on earth? Why are 
we afraid to name those Zionist organizations that seek to take everything we have worked for, all our 
lives, to deny us the right to live in peace, and use what we own instead of having it taken from us and 
given to others? We have been so brain washed that we fear to name our enemies, who seek to destroy 
our freedoms, our farms that produce the bounty that goes on our tables every day, and the produs we 
find in such abundance on the shelves in every store in America. Why do we fear them so much? 

We all know who they are. But we are afraid to  at them, and name them. WHY? Why are 
we afraid to ace the blame for much of the problems we face today, the abusive laws and regulations 
passed at their request: the gargantuan effort to destroy modern technology and devastate our national 
economy, aions that have greatly contributed to the enormous deficit run up by our Zionist controlled 
government: the massive attempt to destroy our freedoms and promote socialism. This blame falls 
squarely on the shoulders, of the Zionist banker financed one world advocates now leading the 
environmental movement. Some of the blame must also fall, on those who follow them blindly, and
