American Intelligence 
on the "Russian Revolution" 

THE American Army Intelligence Service had its agents in 
Russia at the time of the Communist revolution, and the Jewish 
nature of that revolution is accurately refleed in those rerts. 

An American Senate subcommittee investigation o the 
Russian Revolution heard evidence, put on congressional record, 
that "In December , under the presidency of a man named 
Apfelbaum (Zinovieff) . . . out of the  members of the 
Bolshevik central government, only  happened to be real 
Russians, and all the rest (with the exception of a Negro from the 
US) were Jews" (S. Doc. No. , ). 

However, none of these authorities quoted above dared to 
use the language of a US Military Intelligence officer. Captain 
Montgomery Schuyler, who sent two rerts to Washington in 
March and June . These rerts described in graphic detail

the Jewish role in the Russian Revolution, and were only 
declassified in September . The originals are still in the US 
National Archives in Washington and are open for public 
inspeion. 

The first rert, sent from Omsk on March , , contains 
the following paragraph: "it is probably unwise to say this loudly 
in the United States but the Bolshevik movement is and has been 
since its beginning, guided and controlled by Russian Jews of the 
greasiest type."  

The second rert, dated June , , sent from Vladivostok, 
said that of the " commissars there were  Negroes,  
Russians,  Chinamen,  Armenians and more than  Jews. 
Of the latter number  had come to Russia from the United 
States since the downfall of the Imperial Government."  

The Jewish domination of the commissar elite of the early 
Soviet Union ensured that any forms of anti-Semitism were 
regarded as "counterrevolutionary," and anti-Jewish agitation 
was entered o the Soviet law books as a capital penalty crime.
