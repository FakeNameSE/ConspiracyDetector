government must be the ONLY creator of money. They further believed that ALL citizens, of whatever 
State or Tetory, or station in life would benefit by an adequate and stable currency, and therefore, the 
national government must also be, by law, the ONLY controller of the value of money. 

Since the Federal Congress was the only legislative body, subje to all the citizens at the ballot 
box, it was, to their minds, the only safe desitory of so much profit and so much were. They wrote it 
out in the sime, but all-inclusive: Congress shall have the Powere to Coin Money and Regulate the 
Value Thereof. 


HOW THE PEOPLE LOST CONTROL OF AMERICA 
TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKERS 

Instead of the Constitutional method of creating our money and putting it o circulation, we now 
have an entirely unconstitutional system. This has resulted in almost disastrous conditions, as we shall 
see. 

Since our money was handled both legally and illegally before , we shall consider only the 
years following , since from that year on, ALL of our money has been created and issued by an 
illegal method that will eventually destroy the United States if it is not changed. Prior to , America 
was a prosperous, wereful, and growing nation, at peace with its neighbors and the envy of the world. 
But-in December of , Congress, with many members already gone home for the Christmas holidays, 
passed what has since been known as the FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. (For the full story of how this 
infamous legislation was forced through our Congress, read Conquest or Consent, W.B. Vennard). 
Omitting the burdensome details, it simy authorized the establishment of a Federal Reserve 
Corration, with a Board of Zionist Direors (The Federal Reserve Board), to run it, and the United 
States was divided o  Federal Reserve Distris. 

This sime, but teble, law cometely removed from Congress the right to, create money or 
to have any control over its creation, and gave that funion to the Zionist Jewish Federal Reserve 
Corration. This was done with appropriate fanfare, and propaganda that this would remove money 
from litics (they didn`t say and there fore from the people`s control and prevent Boom and Bust 
from hurting our citizens. Before  there was boom and bust, but it was not caused by the Politicians 
as the lying Bankers would have you believe, it was caused by the Bankers themselves. The people were 
not told then, and most still do not know today, that the Federal Reserve Corration is a private 
corration, controlled by Zionist bankers and therefore is operated for the financial gain of the bankers, 
over the people, rather than for the good of the people. THE WORD FEDERAL WAS USED 
ONLY TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE. 

MORE DISASTROUS THAN PEARL HARBOR 

Since that day of infamy, more disastrous to us than Pearl Harbor, the small group of 
privileged people who lend us our money, have accrued to them selves, all of the profits of pring 
our money-and more! Since  they have created tens of trillions of dollars, in money and credit, 
which, as their own personal property, they then lend it, to our government and our people at erest. 
The rich get richer and the or get orer had become the secret licy of our National Government. 
An exame of the process of creation, and its conversion to people`s debt will aid our 
understanding.

THEY PRINT IT WE BORROW IT AND PAY THEM INTEREST 

We shall start with the need for money. The Federal Government, having spent more than it has 
taken from its citizens in taxes, needs, for the sake of illustration, $,,,. Since it does not have 
the money, and Congress has given away its authority to create it, the Government must go the 
creators for the $ billion. But, the Federal Reserve, a private corration, doesn`t just give its money 
away! The Bankers are willing to deliver $,,, in money or credit to the Federal Government 
in exchange for the Government`s agreement to pay it back- with erest! So Congress authorizes the 
Treasury Department to pr $,,, in U.S. Treasury bonds, which are then delivered to the 
Federal Reserve Bankers. 

The Federal Reserve then pays the cost of pring the $,,,. (about $,) and 
makes the exchange. The Government then uses the money to pay its obligations. What are the results 
of this fantastic transaion? Well, $ billion in Government bills are paid all right, but the Government 
has now indebted the people to the Bankers for $ billion, on which the people must pay them erest! 
Tens of thousands of such transaions have taken ace since , so that by now, the U.$. Government 
is indebted to the Bankers for well over ( trillion), on which the people pay over a Trillion dollars a 
year in erest alone with no hope of ever paying off the principal. $upsedly our children and 
following generations will pay forever and forever as they go deeper and deeper o $LAVERY! 

AND THERE`S MORE 

You say, This is teble! Yes, it is, but we have shown only part of the sordid story. Under this 
unholy system, those United $tates Bonds have now become assets of the FRB $ystem, which they 
then use as ``reserves, To create more credit or debt to lend. Current reserve requirements allow 
them to use that $lbillionin bonds to create as much as $ billion in new credit to lend to $tates, 
Municipalities, to individuals and businesses. Added to the original $ billion, they could have $ 
billion of created credit out in loans, paying them erest with their only cost being $, for pring 
the original $ billion! $ince the U.$. Congress has not issued Constitutional moneysincel, (over  
years), in order for the people to have money to carry on trade and commerce they are forced to borrow 
the created credit, of the Monoly Bankers and pay them usury-erest! 

AND THERE`S STILL MORE 

In addition to the vast wealth drawn to them through this almost unlimited usury, the Bankers 
who control the money at the top, are able to approve or disapprove large loans to large and successful 
corrations, to the extent that refusal of a loan will bring about a reduion in the price that 
Corration`s stock sells for on the market. After depressing the price, the Bankers` agents buy large 
blocks of the stock, after which the some times multi-million dollar loan is approved, the stock rises, and 
is then sold for a profit. In this manner billions of dollars are made with which to buy more stock. This 
praice is so refined today that the Federal Reserve Board using this method since , the Bankers and 
their agents have purchased secret or open control, of almost every large corration in America. Using 
that control, they then force the corrations to borrow huge sums from their banks, so that corration 
earnings are siphoned off in the form of erest to the banks. This leaves little as aual profits, which 
can be paid as dividends, and exains why stock prices are so depressed, while the banks reap billions in 
erest from corrate loans. In effe, the bankers get almost all of the profits, while individual 
stockholders are left holding the bag. 

The millions of working families of America are now indebted to the few Banking Families for 
several times the assessed value of the entire United $tates. And these Banking Families obtained that 
debt against us for the cost of paper, ink, and bookkeeping!

THE INTEREST AMOUNT IS NEVER CREATED 

The only way new money (which is not true money, but is credit representing a debt), goes o 
circulation in America, is when it is borrowed from Bankers. When the State and people borrow large 
sums, we seem to prosper. However, the Bankers create only the amount of the principal of each loan, 
never the extra amount needed to pay the erest. Therefore, the new money never equals the new debt 
added. The amounts of money needed to pay erest on loans are not created, and therefore does not 
exist! Under this kind of a system, where new debt always exceeds the new money, no matter how much 
or how little is borrowed, the total debt increasingly outstrips the amount of money available to pay the 
debt. The people can never, ever get out of debt! Compare this with what the bankers used to do in 
Europe by starting out loaning out gold and in a  or  years they had all their gold back, and were 
loaning Gold Certificates repayable in Gold and soon they had all the gold in the Country: Then is 
when all the bank ressessions of homes, farms, corrations etc. started as they are doing today in 
America. An exame will show the viciousness of this usury-debt system with its built-in shortage of 
money. 

IF $, IS BORROWED TO BUY A HOME, 

$,. MUST BE PAID BACK 

The Author tried to build a home in Salt Lake City for $,. Dollars at about % erest on 
a  year Mortgage a few years ago, and I asked how much it would cost in total erest and Principal 
combined. They ran it out and it came to $,. Plus insurance they require you to buy, for  years 
and Taxes of course. This gives the Bank a $,. Dollar profit on money they created out of thin air. 
So I would have had to pay for the house at least  times. The Bank clerk then gives the Borrowere a 
$, check or a $, desit slip crediting the Borrowere`s checking account with $,. 

The Borrowere then writes checks to the builder, subcontraors, etc., who in turn write checks. 
$, of new check book money is thereby added to money in circulation. 

However, and this is the fatal flaw in a usury system, the only new money created and put o 
circulation is the amount of the loan, $,. The money to pay the erest is NOT created, and 
therefore was NOT added to money in circulation. 

Even so, this Borrowere (and those who follow him in ownership of the property), must earn and 
TAKE OUT OF CIRCULATION $,, or $, more THAN HE PUT in circulation WHEN HE 
BORROWED THE ORIGINAL $,! (By the way, it is this erest which cheats all families out of 
nicer homes and keeps them in debt for  years. It is not that they can`t afford them; it is because the 
Banker`s usury forces them to pay for  homes to get one!)
