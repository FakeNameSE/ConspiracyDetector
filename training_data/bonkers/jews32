enough to fight for it. IT WAS THE MINISTERS WHO ORGANIZED THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT 
AGAINST TYRANNY AND FOR FREEDOM. 

Did you ever wonder why today the Churches are forbidden, by federal law from speaking out on 
major Biblical moral issues of our day, such as freedom of speech, who is best suited for public office, 

Page  of  



and against homosexuals, lesbianism, sodomy, abortion, race mixing, etc. when Americas` original 
founding in freedom and independence came o existence, through pastors speaking from the pulpits, 
ayed a key role in asserting the Colonies` rights, to Independence from Great Britain? Much of this 
final squeeze causing final and fatal departure from good old Bible thumping Americanism, started in 

 when the Zionist controlled President Lindon Johnson pushed through Congress the  ( c ) 
 Internal Revenue Code, which has given the government the authority to curtail the free-speech 
rights of all Incorrated religious organizations. 

Since this happened, the Pastors of the Incorrated Churches, who dare speak out against 
the Government or its licies, do so, not only at the risk of going to jail, but also losing the 
Churches tax exempt status, and all personal property and all real estate owned by the Church as 
well. Since this happened the congregations are not taught the sime truths of the Bible any longer 
every other exempt entity except religious institutions, which have broad free-speech rights, but when it 
comes to the Church, they are being treated differently, and that violates the Constitution. The worst 
problem is the Ministers are to dumb to realize or admit, they were wrong, or to take the 
chance of losing the easy money to they have coming in now. 

A free Church is under the sovereignty of God alone, as virtually all Churches were untill, 
when the lying Zionist lawyers started telling Churches they should incorrate and most Churches did 
so, not because it was a law, but, because they were talked o it. The Lawyers will tell us to incorrate 
so that we can defend the Church in court if sued. 

Question: Did you ever hear of a free Church Of GOD being sued? How could you sue a 
Congregation in a church where there was no Corration? No it is the Corration that owns a Church, 
that gets sued, not a Church. Why trade our God given absolute freedom from Taxation and 
Government control, for Government granted privileges, which are at best just cheap 
imitations? We are not above the law. We believe in keeping the laws of God and all moral laws 
of man. 

Question; Why are the religious bigots in State and County Governments, trying to force 
Churches to Incorrate, spending thousands of dollars of tax payers money on lawyers and court costs 
to enforce unconstitutional laws or rules and are trying to use a so called law which they can`t even 
produce For a Ministers to read or to show anyone, when asked, to bully or force Ministers to 
incorrate  before they will recognize them as a Church and give them a tax exemption.. Where do 
they think they got this right or were, or did they just simy usurp it? A corration is a creature 
of the State not of a sovereign God. Why do we have to beg the State to exist? This is putting 
government above the Living God. This is this litical tyranny? They really don`t care what it costs 
us, or the tax payer. Taxing a church is another way the Cities and Counties have to get money to satisfy 
the Zionist Bankers. 

LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE FIGHT HAS JUST BEGUN, Our Declaration of 
Independence, officially exains that; our rights come from the creator [GOD], with certain unalienable 
rights. THEN THE U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that to have your rights; 

"YOU MUST BE THAT BELLIGERENT CLAMANT IN PERSON. 

Ill tell you what their game is; the government has passed literally thousands of laws to control 
Corrations yet in the past  years they have passed no laws to control Churches. They want to 
Control Churches, so they come in the Back door, and get the Churches to incorrate, so they can 
get control over them and tax them! 

What has the Supreme Court already ruled, in case the State or County could make up some kind 
of rule or law to control Churches? It says, and I quote; 

T he general rule is that an unconstitutional statue, weather federal or state, 
though having the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and 
ineffeive for any purse; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enament, and 


Page  of  



not merely from the date of the decision so branding it, an unconstitutional law, in legal 
contemation, it is inoperative as if it had never been passed. Since an unconstitutional law is 
void, the general principals follow that it imses no duties, creates no office, bestows no were or 
authority on anyone, affords no proteion, and justifies no as performed under it. No one is 
bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it."  American 
Jurisprudence d, Constitutional Law, & 

WE WILL NOT INCORPORATE, GET A LICENSE NOR WILL WE JUMP THRU ALL 
THEIR OTHER HOOPS TO BE RECOGNIZED, BECAUSE WE ARE A FREE Church, CREATED 
BY GOD AND HIS SERVANTS, AND WE COVET THIS GOD GIVEN BLESSING . Why should a 
sovereign God in Heaven (a King), have to go to a lesser god the State or the County Court house, to get 
permission to exist as a Church? This is what you would expe to be imsed on the citizens, of a 
totalitarian Communist regime. It is a clear case Government tyranny a cancer in our body litic, a 
disease which will affli us all in time, if we allow it to exist in our local State or County Courthouse. 

In the Court house knowing they don`t have a law to even show you, they will make an arbitrary 
Ruling and then tell you IF YOU DON`T LIKE IT SUE US, knowing the average small Church 
doesn`t have the thousands of dollars it takes to sue, yet the County has unlimited money to hire Lawyers 
etc. 

The answere to this is to have a law like they do in England, where the looser pays the winners 
expenses of bringing the law suit against anyone. That would stop a lot of Court battles, and frivolous 
law suits, but the money hungry Zionist Lawyers who make the laws in this country would never pass, a 
good law like that because it might hurt their selfish money grubbing business. 

Belief in the Holy Bible is only a threat to liticians (litical gangsters), who would like 
totalitarian government controls, and abhor the dorine of liberty, justice and the right of every man to 
be free, which permeates God`s teachings. Liberty is birthed in the Bible. 

I BELIEVE THE GREATEST SINGLE SENTENCE IN THE BIBLE IS: 

" PROCLAIM LIBERTY THROUGHOUT THE LAND UNTO ALL THE 
INHABITANTS THEREOF " Leviticus :. 

Destism may do without religious faith, but freedom can't. None are more hopelessly enslaved 
than those who falsely believe they are free, as most people of America do today. There is no freedom as 
imrtant as religious freedom. 

THE SO CALLED TAX EXEMPTION GIVEN CHURCHES BY 
INCORPORATING 

All I can say about it is what ever the Government gives, they can also take away, and they do! 
So go to your Minister or Preacher and get him to read this book. Pressure him to Dis-Incorrate 
your Church! It can be done as many Patriot Churches are starting to do. 

When we loose our right to be a Free Church, how long will it be before your Church looses its 
right to exist, or is taxed out of existence? This is a God given right, proteed by the Supreme Law of 
our beloved land of America; and the US Constitution. We are fast losing our freedoms in this Country. 

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Never forget, that Through out History, when freedom 
was lost the only way it was ever regained, was through much bloodshed. 

LET`S TALK ABOUT Church TAXATION: 

Questions: When did God start to have to get permission from the State to exist? Where did 
the state get the were to force ministers to be licensed by the state? When did Churches start to have to 
pay taxes unless they were incorrated? When did Ministers have to get approved of, or licensed by the 
State to exist? When did it become mandatory for any Church to incorrate? 

When did it become necessary to incorrate before buying land in the name on your Church? 
When did it become law to get Government permission to build a Church?

Next: We have all heard the famous statement by the great Patriot Patrick Henry when he said; 
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH Very few have heard the rest of the story; 

Patrick Henry had just left Cullpepper Virginia, where he had seen a Minister of God, tied to a 
whipping st in the town square, and publicly whipped, till his bare rib bones were showing, for 
refusing to get a minister`s license. Who wouldn`t get upset about this? This is what caused Patrick 
Henry to make this famous statement; Give me liberty or give me death. As a repercussion of this, 
I understand, in the one state of Virginia, even till this day, it is against the law for a Church to 
incorrate in Virginia. Some thing the Author will always remember is, when he was a boy about , my
