The effes of the disssession of the Palestinians and other Arabs are with us to this day, 
in the shattered lives of the millions of people direly affeed and also as a sign of the West's war 
against the entire Arab nations and Muslims everywhere. Arguably, the original sin of Zionism and 
its effes on the peoples of the Middle East were central to the motivation behind the events of 
/, and the most imrtant consequence of which is the ongoing "war on terrorism" that is 
smothering our litical landscape.

Simon Cozens proses ... that American Christianity ” refeng to what is variously called 
American Evangelism, Christian Zionism, or Dominionism, and comprising much of mainstream 
American Protestantism ” isn't really Christianity at all. It seems they've taken the goriest bits from 
the Old Testament, added the Book of Revelations and a smattering of very Aryan and militaristic 
visual images of J esus, and purrt to call it Christianity.

Bush, Mideast Wars and End-Time Prophecy 

... end-timers all agree that the establishment of Israeli hegemony over the biblical lands 
and the rebuilding of the ancient Jewish teme are preconditions for Christ's return. From this 
belief derives the unwavering suprt of end-time Christians for Israel. Both dominionists and 
dispensationalists call themselves "Christian Zionists." ... [Although a succession of Israeli prime 
ministers has courted the American end-timers (the Christian Zionists) and declared them Israel's 
"greatest friends," the Israelis don't accept the end-time theology one wit. ... However ... the 
Israelis also know that the end-time Christian Zionists are a lobby that can deliver US suprt for 
Israeli hard-line sitions on arms, West Bank settlements, negotiations with the Arabs, and Iran. 
And Zionist agitated war against the Arab countries.

Israel's Pernicious Influence on U.S. Polic 

Robert Fisk, --: 

I wonder why Bush doesn't let Sharon run his press office 

All that he [Bush] offers to the Palestinians is a ghastly 
mockery of what the Palestinians are told to do by the Israelis. 

CNN, --: Big win for Israel's Sharon 

After meeting with Sharon this week, President Bush agreed 
to recognize Israeli settlements in the West Bank, accept 
temrary security fence between Israelis and Palestinians, andl 
repudiate Palestinian claims to a right of return to Israel. In everyl 
case, it's a departure from long-held U.S. sitions. Sharon was, to| 
say the least, eased. 

Ever wonder why Bush gives Sharon everything he wants? Consider this exanation: 
Zionist Israel was involved in the anning for die /  attacks on the Twin Toweres and the 
Pentagon. Bush was instrued as to how he was to behave on the morning of /  when 
informed of the WTC impas. This meeting was captured on video by the Israelis, who have 
given Bush a copy of the tape. If Bush does not give Sharon everything he wants the Israelis will 
leak the video and Bush will be dead meat. 



George Sunderland: Our Vichy Congress 

Lyndon Johnson's decision to cover up the deliberate and protraed Israeli attack on the 
U.S.S. Liberty in June  (and which resulted in  deaths: almost double the deaths suffered by 
the crew of the U.S.S. Cole) was edly not investigated by Congress. Instead, the surviving 
crew, were shamefully bullied o silence by the gargoyle J ohnson and his funionaries; those who 
did break their silence later were reviled by the lobby as delusional anti-Semites. 

Question: Why was the deliberate bombing and strafing of the American Navy ship the 
"U.S.S. Liberty kept from the American people by the Zionist controlled NEWS MEDIA. There was 
a news black out on this secret attack by Israel Air force. Look it up on the I nternet. 

J effrey Steinberg: The 'Ignoble Liars' Behind Bush's Deadly Iraq War 

For Leo Strauss and his discies, the ignoble lie disinformation was the key to achieving and 
holding litical were. And raw litical were was the ultimate goal. For Strauss and the 
Straussians, there were no universal princies, no natural law, no virtue, no agape, no notion of 
man in the living image of God. ... 

Among the other Strauss discies who are currently part of the ongoing neo-con insurgency 
are: John Podhoretz, editorial page editor of Murdoch's yellow tabloid, the New York Post, ... 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Attorney General John Ashcroft [and many others with 
influence on the Bush Administration], 

Andy Beckett: The making of the terror myth 

Although the Islamists and the Straussians have fallen out ... they are in another way ... 
collaborating still: in sustaining the "fantasy" of the war on terror.
