another. On some occasions twice because Jewry has a way of deceitfully worming them selves 
back o the good graces of Christianity. Without exception however they revert to their 
uncontrollable instins, unlike any other race of people known to man. 

The Jewish problem has never been uniquely Protestant or Catholic or in any searian. The 
pioneer of Protestantism. Dr. Martin Luther talked and wrote about the Jews for many years during 
which time he had studied them carefully as a race and a people from the time the Jew was aced on 
earth. This Author has a book by Martin Luther about the Jews and you would think he was writing 
about the Jews of today as they take over all the Banking systems of the world and put everyone in 
Slavery. He was a good writer. 

His original language may be found in Martin Luther's works in the Congressional Library, 
Washington, D.C., and in any one of several accredited Lutheran seminaries. The following are 
quotations of Dr. Martin Luther: 

"The Jews are the real liars and bloodhounds, who have not only perverted and falsified the entire 
Scriptures from beginning to end and without ceasing with their erpretations have lied to and deceived 
their own people. And all of their anxious sighing, longing and hope of their hearts is direed to the time 
when some day they would like to deal with the heathen (Christian) as they dealt with the heathen of 
Persia at the time of Esther. Oh, how they love that book Esther, which so nicely agrees with their 
bloodthirsty, revengeful people as they who imagine to be the people of God who desire to and think they 
must murder and crush the heathen." Their is not one word about God or a prayer in the Book of Ester. 

"Even now the Jews cannot give up their insane, raving boast, that they are the chosen people of 
God, after they have been dispersed and rejeed for  years! Still they hope to get back there because 
of their own merits. There is no promise for that on which they could lean for comfort, except what they 
smear o the Scriptures according to their own imaginations. Thus the Jews continue in their 
willfulness, and knowingly want to err and not leave their Rabbis, and therefore we also must leave them 
to their isonous blasphemies and lies, and disregard them." 

"Therefore know, my dear Christian, that next to the Devil you have no more bitter, more 
isonous, more vehement an enemy than a real Jew who earnestly desires to be a Jew. There may be

some among them who believe what the cow or the goose believes. But all of them are surrounded with 
their blood and circumcision." (Martin Luther's Works, Congressional library Washington D.C.) 

The Fifth Column is presently formed by the descendants of the Jews, who in their earlier 
centuries were converted to Christianity and seemingly held in enthusiastic manner to the religion of 
Christ, (pretended) while in secret they preserved their Jewish belief, exaly kike the Jew converts of 
today. You cannot change the sts on a leopard and, while speaking of cats, this writer would feel safer 
in a cage full of wild cats than with his back turned to a Jew. These masters of deceit smuggled as Fifth 
Column o the bosom of the Church of Christ until now their hycritical conversion to Christianity 
has made it easier and lowered the guard even more as the naive Christian says, when speaking of the 
Jew: "He has become a Christian." "She has been converted." We beg of you, we imore you to 'wake 
up'. How can we be so stupid? When will you learn? Why do you not adopt the methods used in the past 
to arrest the Jews from all forms Christian life before it is too late? Are not the former learned men of the 
Church, including Popes, and rulers of Kingdoms worthy of your thoughtful consideration. History 
shows that these men were to be trusted and they made deep study of the Jew problem. Think about this. 
But if you meditate too long the Jewish-Communist revolution will have made your decision for you. 

The Jews laid aside their Jewish surnames and took on very Christian names, which were 
embellished with the surnames of their godfathers. In this way they were successful in mixing with 
Christian society and taking ssession of the names of the leading families of France, England, Italy, 
Portugal, Spain, Poland, Germany and other lands of Christian Europe. The new generation are now 
taking our American names. Why? The answere is so obvious we will not insult your elligence by 
offering any further exanation. 

EVERY AMERICAN NEGRO SHOULD LEARN ABOUT THIS SUPPRESSED TRUTH. 

ADDENDUM 

This writer's vast research since the pring of the Second Edition more than a year ago compels 
us to bring additional evidence to the surface as that mankind generally, Black and White will remain 
forever convinced that International Jewry ayed a dominant influence both aively and personally in 
slavery throughout the entire world. 

We now learn that the Jews created slavery and praiced it long before the birth of Jesus Christ. 
Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, p. . Rabbi Lewis Browne, in his Stranger Than Fiion, p. , says 
that "under the tolerant rule of the Mohammedans, the Jews began slavery and began to prosper. They 
who had been or and bedraggled peddlers for centuries, now became wealthy and wereful traders. 
They traveled everywhere, from England to India, from Bohemia to Egypt. Their commonest 
merchandise in those days was slaves. On every highroad and on every great river and sea, these Jewish 
traders were to be found with their gangs of shackled prisoners in convoy." 

Albert M. Hyamson (A History of the Jews in England, p. ) makes the eresting observation 
that the Jewish slave traders were probably indirely resnsible for the conversion of Britain to 
Christianity. Homer mentions Cyprus and Egypt as the common markets for slaves, about the time of the 
Trojan war. Egypt is represented in the book of Genesis as a market for slaves, and in Exodus as famous 
for the severity of its servitude. Tyre and Sidon, as we learn from the book of Joel, were notorious for the 
prosecution of the slave trade. Although this trade was not confined to the Jews they nevertheless 
roduced it throughout all Asia and spread it through the Grecian and Roman world. As the northern 
nations were settled in their conquests, the slavery and commerce of the human species began to decline, 
and were finally abolished. Some writers have ascribed this result to the prevalence of the feudal system; 
while others, a much more generous class, have maained that it was the natural effe of Christianity. 
Christianity was admirably adapted to this purse. It taught "that all men were originally equal; that the 
Deity was not respeer of persons; and that, as all men were to give an account of their aions hereafter, 
it was necessary that they should be free."

Albert Hyamson says: "The British slaves who, in the Roman market-ace, attraed the attention 
of King Gregory, and direed it towards Britain, were most probably roduced o Italy by Jewish 
merchants." The first attempt by the British to establish a regular slave trade on the African coast, was 
made in the year , when James I, granted an exclusive charter to Sir Robert Rich and some other 
Jewish merchants of London for raising a jo stock company to trade to Guinea. 

"If the truth were fully known," says Rabbi Lewis Brown in "Stranger Than Fiion" (p. ), 
"probably it would be found that the learned Jews in Provence, Italy were in large part resnsible for the 
existence of the free-thinking se (the Albigenses). The dorines which the Jews had been spreading 
throughout the land for years could not but have helped to undermine the Church's were." Jewish 
writers boast of the share Jews have had in encouraging heresies within the Catholic Church. "As a 
whole," says I. Abrahams (JEWISH LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES) "heresy was a reversion to Old 
Testament and even Jewish ideals. It is indubitable that the heretical dorines of the southern French 
Albigenses in the beginning of the thirteenth century, as of the Hussites in the fifteenth, were largely the 
result of friendly ercourse between Christians and educated Jews." See also Graetz, History of the 
Jews, Vol. Ill, ch. xv, English translation, and Rabbi Newman's Jewish influence on Christian Reform 
Movements. 

The European Jewish merchants found it more praical to establish their own people in Africa 
and secure themselves by fortified sts, changing the earlier system of force o that of pretended 
liberality; and of opening by every species of bribery and corruption, a communication with the natives. 
Accordingly they ereed their forts and faories; landed their merchandise, and endeavored by a 
peaceable dertment, by presents, and by every appearance of munificence, to allure the attachment and 
confidence of the Africans. The scheme succeeded. An ercourse took ace between the Merchants 
and Africans, attended with a confidence highly favorable to the views of ambition and avarice. In order 
to render the dealings permanent as well as lucrative, the merchants paid their court to the African chiefs, 
and a treaty of peace and commerce was concluded. Although the Merchants violated the treaty in every 
conceivable manner known to man, thus was laid the foundation of that nefarious commerce, of which, 
this writer has uncovered a wealth of buried treasure relating to 'Slavery', beginning in the early centuries 
until its abolishment in America - and the Jewish merchants continued in this lucrative praice of slavery 
for some years after it had been declared illegal. 

This treatise was originally prepared to bring to the surface only a few bare fas relating to 
Jewish slavers and Jew owned slavers and Jew owned slave ships, most of which have been suppressed 
these many, many years. Search however led to more search and the evidence is so enormous of how Jew 
merchants throughout the world gradually gained control of the barbarous praice of slavery. There now 
remains no doubt of the gigantic role the Jews ayed in the monolistic roduion of slaver to 
America and my references have become a cross-file of the worst kind of evidence against these 
unscrupulous, conscienceless people and it is their ancestors who today, secretly suprt Communism 
and then pretend to be "Anti-Communist." If some of our Anti- Communists would tell this ain truth, 
we might ssibly yet be liberated from Jewish misrule. This truth about slavery should be made a part of 
our American history and taught in the schools so that children may learn the FACTS. 

However, children sometimes exercise an instin adults stifle. Houston Stewart Chamberlain in 
his Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, Vol. I, p. ,  edition said: "It frequently happens that 
children, who have no conception of what 'Jew' means, or that there is any such thing in the world, begin 
to cry as soon as a genuine Jew or Jewess comes near them!" You may take this reference of 
Chamberlain's for what it may be worth but I hasten to add that his works, Vol. I & II arrested the 
attention of the literary world, and was speedily declared to be one of the masterpieces of the century. Do 
not minimize this great scholar of natural science.
