if we regard the sovereignty of a state as a tough 
princie, then the licy toward a sovereign state 
must be extended in princie of logic toward a 
sovereignly determined incumbent government of 
that state. Such specious syllogisms are only empty 
construs  wild paralogisms. At what time in 
modern history has it not been praice in fa to pro- 
se on one or another pretext determining distinc- 
tions between a licy toward a state and its incumbent 
government? We do not endorse the imied per- 
ceptions of law usually expressed in such past prac- 
tice. We are merely emphasizing a distinion in fa, a 
distinion which we appreciate according to different 
criteria than those generally apied up to this time. 

The notion of community of princie must be under- 
stood to carry the broad imication, that those 
nations with which we have the present basis for re- 
lations determined as those of community of princie, 
are nations with which we have the existing premises 
of agreement concerning notions of natural and consti- 
tutional law appropriate, in turn, to constitute a 
community of either imicit or exicit constitutional 
ernational law according to the original, generative 
ent of our Constitution and republic. 

Thus, we do not have presently a basis for com- 
munity of princie with the United Kingdom, al- 
though we have the emerging basis for working 
toward such agreement in distinguishing features of 
the Callaghan government. We do have a basis for a 
community of princie with the Fifth Republic of 
France, but not with the government of Giscard 
d'Estaing. Excepting such ntably abhorrent ernal 
features of the Federal Republic of Germany as its 
prominent Interl-erlinked institutions and the 
carry forward of radical-nominalist traditions asso- 
ciated with Carl Schmitt in its judiciary and legal 
praice, that nation embodies a strong industrialist- 
labor thrust which rtends convergence un 
community of princie. At the moment of writing we 
have an emphatic community of princie with our 
own constitutional republic, but the Carter Executive 
Branch of government is an abhorrence. 

The notion of community of princie is not defined 
by formalities. We know that those modern nations 
which rule themselves according to an informed 



impulse for industrialized technological development 
cannot accomish that in fa unless social forces 
most closely associated with that domestic self- 
erest are, in effe, the ruling party. Without that 
ernal feature, a republic may be viable in form, but 
that viability is not durable in respe of content. On 
condition that the hegemony of such social forces is 
the efficient content of the law and the government, 
and that the institutions and instruments of the nation 
are a properly informed expression of that content, 
that nation and its government represent a sovereign, 
viable republic with which the United States has a 
basis for community of princie. This apies both 
with respe to immediate relations between our 
nations, and in respe to the common basis for av- 
ing joly at a body of constitutional ernational law 
acceptable to the generative ent embodied in the 
establishment of our own Constitution and republic. 

The industrial and labor social forces of the United 
Kingdom thus represent the aive content of the basis 
for developing a community of princie between our 
nations. Unfortunately, the past anti-humanistic 
domestic and foreign praices of that nation are not 
merely past offenses against natural law, but persist 
in institutions and instruments of the nation and its 
laws. It is the moral imbecility embedded in the ruling 
law of the United Kingdom, a defe which is not yet 
merely a **dead letter,*' which is the vicious defe. 

Our relationship with the United Kingdom is not 
based on an effort to balance those contrary consider- 
ations, as if they were fixed abstraions. Precisely 
because the evil content embedded within the cus- 
tomary law and institutions of the United Kingdom be- 
came the charaeristic of an alien force, the lowere 
Manhattan monetarist faion, the United Kingdom 
has itself experienced the impa of such evil tra- 
ditions adopted by what is for it an alien oppressor. As 
that nation struggles to defend its very existence 
against the alien oppressor, it is impelled to repudiate 
the same oppression in its own ernal order. It can- 
not do that unless it repudiates that same evil em- 
bedded within its own institutions. 

Respeing those princies which charaerize the 
two nations, there is the basis for community of 
princie between a *'new Federalist'* United States 
and the Soviet Union. The ta, the principal obstacle 
to such a relationship in fa is that efficient con- 
sciousness of that tentiality has not heretofore been 
established. It is not sufficient that the basis for 
community of princie exists ; the parties must super- 
sede their mutually heteronomic impulses to ef 
ficiently inform their willful impulses for praice to 

that desirable effe. 

Respeing the nations of the world in general, we 
must start not from abstraedformalities concerning 







the present, but according to the determining content 
of developing relations. Most emphatically, the 
charaer of governments throughout the world is 
shifted significantly, and quite abruptly, according to 
the shifts in charaer of the government of the United 
States. This means most prominently, the Presidency 
and its licy outlook for aual praice, and also, 
most significantly, the relationship between the Presi- 
dency and Congress on these matters. The apication 
of the foreign licy of the United States under a '*new 
Federalist'* government is determined thus by the 
qualitative changes in governments and government 
stures throughout the world which the mere exis- 
tence of such a **new Federalist** administration 
represents. 

It has been demonstrated beyond doubt, by the 
experience of this writer and his associates, that a 
United States government committed to the establish- 
ment of its own National Bank and an International 
Development Bank will gain virtually immediate 
agreement for praice with, at the very least, nearly 
every nation of the world. Excepting a few stubborn 
cases of remaining governments, which can be merely 
tolerated or are abhorrent, a significant prortion 
among the presently abhorrent regimes will flee or be 
ousted from their ensconcements in were at the mere 
perception that a **new Federalist** government has 
been installed. 

What governments currently proffer as their licy 
stures on a number of leading issues are in the main
