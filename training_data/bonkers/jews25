AND THERE`S MORE 

The profits from these massive debts have been used, to ere a comete and almost hidden 
economic and litical colossus, over our nation. They keep telling us they are trying to do us good, 
when in truth they work to bring harm and injury to our people. These would-be dests know it is 
easier to control and rob an ill, orly-educated and confused people, than it is a healthy and elligent 
pulation. So they deliberately prevent real cures for diseases, they degrade our educational systems, 
and they stir up social and racial unrest. For the same reason they favor drug use, alcohol, sexual 
promiscuity, abortion, rnography, and crime, racial ermaage with Africans, which has been illegal 
from Christian Bible times immemorial. Everything which debilitates the minds and bodies of the people 
is secretly encouraged, as it makes the people less able to opse them or even to understand what is 
being done to them. 

Family, morals, love of Country, the Christian religion, all that is honorable, is being swept away, 
while they try to build their new subservient man. Our new rulers are trying to change our whole 
racial, social, religious, and litical order, but they will not change the debt-money economics system, 
by which they rob and rule us. Our people have become tenants and debt-slaves, to the Bankers and 
their agents in the land our fathers conquered. IT IS CONQUEST THROUGH THE MOST GIGANTIC 
FRAUD, AND SWINDLE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. And we remind you again: the key to 
their wealth and were over us is their ability to create money out of nothing, and lend it to us at 
erest. If they had not been allowed to do that, they would never have gained secret control of our 
nation. How tme Solomon`s words are: " The rich ruleth aver the or, and the borrowere is servant to the lender" 
(Proverbs :). 

God Almighty warned us in the Bible that one of the curses which would come un His Peoe 
for disobeying His laws was: " the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very 
high; and thou shalt come down very low. He shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to 
him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail 

Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European Zionist Jewish 
ancestry and conneed with the Rothschild European banks. Has that warning come to fruition in 
AMERICA 


CHAPTER  

THE CONSTITUTIONAL WAY - EVERY CITIZEN A STOCKHOLDER 

Now let`s consider the corre method of providing the medium of exchange, (money) needed by 
our people. 

If we would have used the Constitutional way of creating the money needed in the nation, the Federal 

Congress would spend most of its time and study on the issuance and control of an adequate 
supy of stable money for the people. If an increase of pulation and produion required an increase 
in the medium of exchange, Congress would authorize the coining. (i.e., pring) of the determined 
amount. Some could be used to pay current legitimate expenses of the Federal Government, with the 
balance paid direly to the citizens. Records for payment would be similar to Social Security records, 
except a citizen would be recorded at birth, instead of when he first goes to work. Each person on the 
records as of the date of the Congressional authorization would receive an equal amount just as if he 
were a stockholder holding one share. Just think - payment of only $ to each citizen would put $ 
billion of debt-free and erest-free money o circulation. 

Such a suggestion always scares the Bankers. Their propagandist will immediately cry, pring 
press money, and warn that it would soon be worthless and would cause inflation. 

The truth is their immense usury charges on their created credit (our debt) is the sole 
cause of inflation and always has been. Today all prices, on all industry, trade and labor must be 
raised periodically, to pay the ever increasing usury charges. That is the ONLY cause of higher prices, 
and the money-changers spend millions in propaganda to keep you from realizing that theirs is the 
Pring press money. 

The money-creators (Bankers) know that if we ever tried a Constitutional issue of debt-free, 
erest-free currency, even a limited issue, that benefits would be apparent immediately. That they must 
prevent. Abraham Lincoln was the last President to issue such debt-free and erest-free currency (in 
) and he was assassinated shortly thereafter. 

WHY BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK? 

Research the following your self! The Federal Reserve Bank (FED) has been privately owned for 
nearly  years; see the Encyclopedia Britannia. 

The FED creates money out of thin air and loans it out at erest . National Geographic, Jan. 
 Page . This direly violated the constitution Article one seion eight and ten. 

The New York FED published a book, I bet you thought it says commercial banks create 
checkbook money whenever they grant a loan, simy by adding desit dollars to accounts on their 
books in exchange for Borrowere`s IOU... 

Simy put when you sign a Mortgage NOTE you, the borrowere, created Money according to the 
uniform Commercial code (UCC). This note is desited on the banks books just like you would 
desit cash allowing you to write a bank check. The bank got your money (NOTE) erest free, to 
exchange it for bank checks and loaned vour money back to you at erest . The banks balance sheet 
proves it when you ask, where is the cash? 

Banks make profit from uninformed borroweres. Banks are so afraid you will find out, they own 
& control all major news media per  & Congressional rert. For proof read En Rout To 
Global Occupation By Gary Kah Pages - and also The New World Order by Robertson pages 
-. 

If you are uninformed the bank will have you work and labor to pay it back $,. erest the 
principal on a $,. mortgage. They use your mortgage NOTE erest free, so you can work to 
give them, THE BANKER$ back a profit of $,. erest.

NO BANKER`S PLUNDER 

Under a Constitutional system no private banks would exist to rob the people. 

Government banks under the control of the people`s representatives, would issue and control all 
money and credit. They would issue not only aual currency, but could lend limited credit, at no erest 
for the purchase of capital goods, such as homes. A $,. loan would require only $,. 
repayment, not $,. as it is now. Everyone who supied materials and labor for the home would 
get paid just as they do today, but the bankers would NOT get $,. in usury, as profit, AND THAT 
IS WHY THEY RIDICULE AND DESTROY ANYONE SUGGESTING GOVERNMENT 
(CITIZENS`) MONEY WITHOUT INTEREST, AND WITHOUT DEBT, like they do our friend 
Congressman Ron Paul the only man with guts enough to speak out against the Zionist owned 
FEDERAL RESERVE BANKERS. 

History tells us of debt-free and erest-free money issued by governments. The American 
colonies did it in the `s, and their wealth soon rivaled England and brought restriions from 
Parliament, which led to the Revolutionary War. Abraham Lincoln did it inl, to help finance the 
Civil War. He was later assassinated by an agent of the Rothschild Bank. No debt-free or erest-free 
money has been issued in America since then. Several Arab nations issue erest-free loans, to their 
citizens today. The Saracen Empire forbad erest on money for , years, and its wealth out shone 
even Saxon Europe. Mandarin China issued its own money, erest-free and debt-free, and historians 
and colleors of art today consider those centuries to be China`s time of greatest wealth, culture and 
peace. 

Germany issued debt-free and erest-free money from  and on, accounting for its starling 
rise from the depression, to a world were in  years. Germany financed its entire government and war 
operation from  to  without gold and without debt, and it took the whole Zionist owned 
Banker controlled Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German were over Europe and bring 
Europe back under the heel of the Bankers. $uch history of money does not even appear in the textbooks 
of public (government) schools today. 

Issuing money which doesn`t have to be paid back in erest leaves the money available to use in 
the exchange of goods and services, and its only continuing cost is reacement as the paper wears out. 
Money is the paper ticket by which such transfers are made, and should always be in sufficient quantity 
to transfer all ssible produion of the nation to ultimate consumers. 

It is as ridiculous for a nation to say to its citizens, You must consume less because we are short 
money, as it would be for an Airline to say Our anes are flying, but we can`t take you because we are 
short of tickers. 


WHAT FAMIOUS MEN HEP TO SAY ABOUT THE JEWS 
STUYVESANT, PETER. th. c. Dutch first governor of New York in America. The Jews who have 
aved would nearly all like to remain here, but learning that they (with their customary usury and 
deceitful trading with the Christians) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates, as also to the 
people having the most affeion for you; the Deaconry also fearing that owing to their present indigence
