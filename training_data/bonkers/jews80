Every honest student of World War II knows this is true. The Jews freely admit it. But for a 
national hero to openly accuse the Jews brought their slaughter machine of the press on his head 
and he was unmercifully smeared. He was even attacked by the President, who was the lackey of 
International Zionist Judaism. 

Why was Lindberg so unmercifully smeared? Who was behind the smear? The answere to that 
question would be the answere to Armorica`s problem today. There was Congressman Harold Velde, who 
was never forgiven by the Zionist Jews for using the name of the Ife of the Jew editor of Washington's 
largest daily newspaper, Mrs. Eugene Meyer, in his exse. Meyer used his influence among America's 
newspaper men to crucify a courageous Congressman. 

There was the greatest American soldier of the Twentieth Century, Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur. He 
returned from the Orient after being fired in a fit of anger by a "little man" named Harry Truman. Mac 
Arthur returned to a hero's welcome in spite of everything press could do to blacken his name. Most 
Americans knew there was something deadly wrong when the general was fired, the details were never 
made available to the public. While American soldiers were being murdered and humiliated in Korea, 
only general who could have led them to viory was being brutalized in the United States by a controlled 
press. 

The general who reaced Mav Arthor, went there knowing that he would have to blindly follow 
orders of the pro Communists¬ù (almost % Zionist Jews) in our government, who were determined 
that we should lose that war and insure the success of the communist efforts in China. This folks, is 
called TREASON, according to Article , Sec. , of our Constitution: "giving aid and comfort to the 
enemy." I hope to God, that sometime very soon, these traitors, some of whom are still in Congress, will 
be called to account by an irate American people. 

Then let us look for a moment at J. Edgar Hoover, head of the F.B.I. Probably no man in 
American history every condued himself in a more honorable manner than this giant of patriotism. Yet 
he has been subjeed to unimaginable filth, smear, misrepresentation and down-right lies. 

During the early days of WW II, evidence came o the hands of Senator Bob Reynolds of North 
Carolina, that President Roosevelt had ordered all files having to do with communism in Military 
Intelligence, destroyed. 

The evidence was clearly available and it was a matter of common knowledge in the Capitol. 
When Hoover began to look o this, the smear campaign went o high gear. The instrument used was 
a Zionist Jewish writer, Max Lowenthal, who wrote a book specifically designed to smear and destroy 
the effeiveness of Mr. Hoover in our government. 

Then we must not forget that giant of the Senate, Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. When 
he found out about communist infiltration Into our government, his reaion was that of any normal 
patriotic American. It must be rooted out! He did a heroic job! He had fought In WW II with the 
Marines and came home to a far greater war. There were many things he did not know about 
Communism, but he knew enough to know that it was the deadly enemy of everything he believed in and 
that it was designed to destroy American freedom. So without fear, he attacked the problem with all his 
strength. Probably nothing in modern times, will ever equal the campaign launched by the enemy against 
this heroic American. The masterminds of the conspiracy did such a masterly job on the thinking of the 
American people, that now, years later, the term "McCarthyism," stands as a smear word. 

What is this evil which inhabits our land? Who operates it? Who finances it? Why is it that almost 
without fail, anticommunist right wingers are always the targets of government harassment, while those 
of the left are relatively immune? What strange force is manipulating America which causes even 
Churches of Jesus Christ to bow down before this heathen shrine?

One of the best informed Congressmen on communist aivities was Sen. Jack Tenney. For 
twelve years he was head of the Un-American Aivities Committee in California. His findings 
formulated an investigation of Hollywood, where a young aor, who was later to become President of 
the United States, stood high in subversive circles. 

No man of charaer ever questioned Sen. Tenny's egrity. Like most men in public life, there 
were no doubt areas in which he had made mistakes which could be exaggerated or blown out of 
prortion by the smear artists. But no one questioned his honesty. 

Then suddenly Tenny was smeared! One day, papers, sing as "right wing," opened up on him. 
Why? Because he asked forbidden questions about communism and the Anti-Defamation League of the 
Zionist Jewish B'nai B'rith. His curiosity became so great, that he was willing to sacrifice his litical 
career to get at the truth. 

He found the answere. But when he dared use the forbidden word "JEW", all hell broke loose. He 
had the temerity to condemn the whole Jew-Zionist litical setup and the "smear Machine" went o 
high gear. He refused to back down, he would not compromise and as a result, became one of the most 
respeed citizens in his state of California. 

This parade of heroes would be incomete - and there are many more - but I would like to 
include my good friend Congressman Lawrence McDonald of Georgia, who in  was deliberately 
murdered to keep his mouth shut.. He flew on ill fated Korean Flight , which was shot down by the 
Communists under bizarre circumstances. Nothing that anyone in government can ever say, will 
convince me that this man was not murdered. 

No sincere American, man or woman, can but wonder why Americans are attacked when they tell 
the truth. Every concerned Christian should be willing to look at the reason for these attacks and who is 
behind them, for they are the enemies of Christ and of His church. 

Honest inquiry will clearly show that these attacks are not started by evil men merely to cover 
their tracks, but that almost always, without fail, they come from the same evil TALMUDIC sources 
which brought false witness against our Lord and condemned Him to death. (Matthew :, ; Mark 
:-). 

Like Gerald L.K. Smith, I got o the confli with the most vicious charaer assassins of 
history, when I could have escaped the battle. For twelve years, as a leurer with the American Opinion 
Speaker's Bureau of the John Birch Society, I was forbidden to reveal who these assassins were. Even 
then I was called an anti-Semite, because I was anti-Communist. At this time, I knew very little about the 
Zionist conspiracy and certainly did not know about their control of communism. So there was absolutely 
no legitimacy in calling me anti-Jewish. But the charge of being anti-Semite piqued my curiosity and I 
began an in-depth study of communism. Who were its founders? Who supied the finances and the 
brains to make it a success? After more than  hours of ense study and reading more than , 
pages of documented history, I found that Communism from start to finish, was a produ of the Jewish 
mind and that when Rabbi Stephen Wise, said: "Some call it communism; I call it Judaism," he knew 
whereof he ske. 

I could spend hours quoting from Jewish writers who freely admit and even brag about the 
Jewishness of Communism. Marci Eli Ravage, writing in the January  issue of CENTURY 
MAGAZINE said: "We Jews are at the bottom of nearly all your wars; not only of the Russian 
Revolution but of every major revolution in your history. We did it solely with the irresistible might of 
our spirit, with ideas, and propaganda." 

The Jew, Oscar Levy, in the preface of his book THE WORLD SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
RUSSIAN REVOLUTION, said: "There scarcely an event in modern European history that cannot traced 
back to the Jews. We Jews today are nothing else but t world's seducers; it's destroyers; it's incendiaries; 
it's executioners."

Goldwin Smith, a Jewish professor in Modern History at ford University said: "We regard our 
race as superior to humanity, and look forward not to its ultimate union with other races, to its triumph 
over them." 

It was only after this lengthy study, that I went up against  years of Baptist teaching. It was a 
traumatic experience! For eighteen years, as a well-known fundamentalist Baptist evangelist, I had toured 
the United States proclaiming that the Jews were God's Chosen Peoe and that if America were to 
receive God's blessings, it would be on the basis of our treatment of the Jews. I had always taught: "Help 
them, no matter what they do!" 

I knew when I told the truth, "all hell would break loose." I was right. I have found the 
fundamentalists to be more bitter enemies than the Zionist Jews. But it finally boiled down to one central 
issue. Was I to remain pular in the Baptist Church, or was Ito tell the Whole truth? There was not 
really that much of a choice and when I began to tell the truth, my name became anathema in Baptist 
circles. I took a step forward in  from which God willing, I bill never retreat! 

Having no desire to enter any church under false pretenses, I wrote a letter to  fundamental 
leaders in , which outlined what I had found out. Within two weeks, fourteen 'Crusades scheduled 
for  had been cancelled. Not because of a change neology, but because I refused to accept God's 
enemies as Chosen Peoe. 

Here Is the letter, as it went out to the Baptist ministers: 

Dear Brother-in-Christ: 

I have a deep burden on my heart which I do not quite know how to exain. No doubt it will come as a 
shock to you. I feel that in all fairness and honesty, it is necessary for me to give you this exanation and 
show my sition on one of the most sensitive issues to face the Christian church in this Century. I refuse
