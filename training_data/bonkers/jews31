The Bible has scores of passages condemning the robbery, of the workers and the or, by the 
wicked. For a Bible-related study of this evil system of under, write to the author of this booklet for a

Order additional copies of BILLIONS FOR THE BANKERS from: AMERICA`S PROMISE 
MINISTRIES, P.O. Box , Phoenix, Arizona . Request  or more. (They like my self also 
give you permission to repr them, if you can save money by doing so.) 

Give or mail them out by the hundreds to awaken and educate other Americans, to this fantastic under 
of the working people of A merica. The cost to you is VERY LITTLE, compared to the BILLIONS in 
money and property being STOLEN from YOU, and the rest of the people in America. 




CHAPTER  

THE UNGODLY SIN OF A MINISTER GETTING 
HIS Church INCORPORATED 

I BLAME THE CHRISTIAN MINISTERS OF TODAY, FOR ALL OF AMERICA BEING 
MADE SLAVES, BY THE ZIONIST FEDERAL RESERVE BANKING SYSTEM. Read on to find 
out why. The modern Preachers are so heavenly minded they are no earthly good. 

Remember it was through the Inspiration, of the Colonial Ministers and Preachers teaching 
freedom from the word of God, in the Bible that brought about the BOSTON TEA PARTY, and the 
eventual freedom we HAD so long in this country, and made this Country so Free and Great before , 
when the FRB started running the country and by now, have ENSLAVED the entire Population, in an 
ever growing debt that can never be paid.. 

First Amendment of the United States Constitution, says and I quote; CONGRESS SHALL 
MAKE NO LAW RESPECTING AN ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION OR PROHIBITING THE 
FREE EXERCISE THERE OF; OR ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, OR OF THE PRESS; 
OR THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE, AND TO PETITION THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES.  

This NO LAW concept is one law Congress has faithfully kept for over  years. They have 
passed no laws controlling Churches. All State and local Governments are also under the laws of the 
US Constitution not to pass any laws controlling Churches. 

The above amendment was so imrtant, to our Forefathers; it was put ahead of the very next or 
Second amendment, "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. " 

TODAY THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF "CHURCHES. The original is started by God and 
his servants. 

The second is a So Called Church corration, and is a Creature of the State. 

There are also two sets of Laws affeing them in the IRS Code as we will get to. 

First Amendment of the United States Constitution, says and I quote again; "CONGRESS SHALL 
MAKE NO LAW RESPECTING AN ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION OR PROHIBITING THE FREE 
EXERCISE THERE OF; " 

Under the NO LAW concept of the First Article of the Constitution of the United States of 
America, there is not any requirement, by law, for the Church to make apication for recognition of 
Exempt Status? 


BUT WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THIS 

THE IRS CODE MAKES AN EXCEPTION FOR FREE CHURCHES THE Zionist taught 
LAWYERS DON`T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT. Free Churches are Unregistered Churches; 
In other words a free Church is under God only, and they know it. 

Code [a] -New organizations must notify the secretary that they are apying for recognition 
of  [c] [] status EXCEPT as provided in subseion [c], page  

A Free Church which is also recognized in the same IRS Code at: 

 [c] [] [A] which reads and I quote: Mandatory exceptions - seions - [a] and [b] shall not 
apy to [A] Churches, their egrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of Churches.  

This may seem strange to the uninformed or ignorant, that the IRS lists corrations for 
religious purses under  [c] (), and other Churches (free Churches) under  [c] [] [A], 
Could it be ssible the IRS knows something % of the preachers, and most Lawyers and liticians, 
don`t know or won`t tell you? Could it be ssible that lawyers for the Churches who are advising

Churches to incorrate, are doing so simy to make money for themselves? It costs money to set up 
and maain a Corration. I have a problem with a Church, which should be only under the 
Sovereignty of God, asking a lesser sovereign [the State] for the right to exist, and then for a tax exempt 
status, when they are immune from taxes from the beginning in the IRS Code. This is begging the state 
for the right to exist. 

As you can see any law the state or the Federal Government were to pass, controlling Churches, is 
an unconstitutional law, and the law would be null, void and of no effe from the day it was passed. On 

the other hand, once a Church volunteers to incorrate, it becomes a  creation of the 
Government  NOT GOD and there are thousands of laws controlling Corrations already in 
existence. And if any of these laws are broken the Government can Padlock the Church, take the 
land and buildings and fine the Minister, or imprison him, all of which they are already doing! 

When we take o consideration all the other religious organizations in the United States, the 
rites of one religious body are considered in the courts, just as credible as any other. Today this is even 
erpreted by the courts to mean, even the God and Bible denying Satanist and witches in their 
Churches. Why can`t the county Tax Assessors recognize, a sime non denominational Bible believing 
Church? 

NO LAW, is NO LAW AT ALL 

Where did this SO-Called Separation of Church and State  GARBACH  come from? 

No where in the U. S. Constitution, the Bill of rights or anywhere else in the papers the founding 
fathers gave this Country, can the lie about the so called separation of Church and state be found. 
In fa never in history, has the Bible been left out of Government until, this Zionist promulgated 
lie got started in the U. S. A. Now look at the trouble this country is in. This lie came from a 
misunderstood statement, by Thomas Jefferson who had no part in writing these documents. Yet 
for years I have heard Government officials and news commentators esuse the false Dooring of 
separation of Church and State, while at the same time making tyrannical Edis that a Church 
must be created by the State, thorough incorration and licensing of Ministers. 

In England and other Countries the Governments taxed the people to Suprt only the State 
snsored Churches. Even if you belonged to another Church of your choice, you were still taxed, to 
suprt the State Church. Our Foundling Fathers wanted none of this; they wanted everyone to suprt 
the Church or their choice, in other words freedom of religion . So when they formed our Constitution 
they deliberately put in the Concept THEIR WOULD BE NO STATE RELIGION by saying that; 
 Congress shall make no law respeing an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof; ....etc. So this took away the chance that you could ever be taxed for a Church, you did not 
belong to or want to suprt. There could never be a State Church in America. 

First you may think this has nothing to do with the Zionist Bankers, but if the Churches were not 
incorrated the Ministers could speak, out against the tyranny and robbery of the Federal Reserve 
Bankers and the Politicians in Government who suprt it. The ones resnsible for all the bad laws, and 
keeping them in control of America, and making Slaves of all Americans, to the Illegal, Immoral, 
unconstitutional Income Tax system, these Zionist FRB bankers brought on to the Country in . The 
Churches could teach the people about the Constitution, Good Government, Good laws verses Bad Laws, 
as the Ministers did when this Country was founded, and won its independence from the Tyranny, of the 
Tyrannical Kings of England. It was the Ministers and the Bible teachings that led the fight against 
England, and their Tyrannical laws and taxation, and won our freedom from England. At the time we 
didn`t even have an army, but the Ministers first taught then organized the people to want freedom bad
