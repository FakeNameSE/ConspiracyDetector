from Western banking institutions are the ones in danger of facing the wrath of the imperial war 
machine. Incidentally, most oil-rich nations in the Middle East have outlawed usury (lending money with 
erest), making them imssible to conquer diomatically through debt . Controlling the world reserve 
currency means controlling the tap of life itself, which is a dangerous wean in the hands of an 
aggressive empire. Debt is the ultimate WMD the empire uses to enslave the world, which leaves 
dissidents with two clear choices: slavery or death. 

Although this empire is infinitely more wereful than Rome was, it will likely suffer the same 
fate. For every negative aion the empire commits, there's an equal and opsite good reaion. And the 
goodness of humanity will always defeat tyranny when it goes too far. However, an empire with so much 
to lose will go down swinging and slinging every wean in its arsenal, thus putting the final stamp on 
their status as most brutal empire in history. 

Israel simy has no right to exist 
Peace might have a real chance without Israelis' Biblical claims 

Special rert: Israel and the Middle East

Article history 

Several years ago, I suggested in my students' union newspaper that Israel shouldn't exist. I also 
said the sympathy evoked by the Holocaust was a very handy cover for Zionist Israeli atrocities. 
Overnight I became public enemy number one. I was a Muslim fundamentalist, a Jew-hater, somebody 
who trivialized the memory of the most abominable a in history. My denouncers followed me, 
photographed me, and even put telephone calls through to my family telling them to expe a call from 
the grim reaper. 

Thankfully, my notoriety in Jewish circles has since waned to the extent that recently I gave an 
er-faith leure snsored by the Leo Baeck College, even though my views have remained the same. 
Israel has no right to exist. I know it's a hugely unfashionable thing to say and one which, given the 
current parlous state of the peace process, some will also find irresnsible. But it's a fa that I have 
always considered central to any genuine peace formula. 

Certainly there is no moral case for the existence of Israel. Israel stands as the realization of a 
biblical statement. Its raison d'etre was famously delineated by former Prime Minister Golda Meir. "This 
country exists as the accomishment of a promise made by God Himself. It would be absurd to call its 
legitimacy o account." 

That biblical promise is Israel's only claim to legitimacy. But whatever God meant when he 
promised Abraham that "unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, 
the Euphrates," it is doubtful that he ended it to be used as an excuse to take by force and chicanery a 
land lawfully inhabited and owned by others. 

It does no good to anyone to brush this fa, uncomfortable as it might be, under the table. But 
that has been the failing with Oslo. When it signed the agreement, the PLO made the cardinal error of 
assuming that you could bury the hatchet by rewriting history. It accepted as a starting  that Israel 
had a right to exist. The trouble with this was that it also meant, by extension, an acceptance that the way 
Israel came o being was legitimate. As the latest troubles have shown, ordinary Palestinians are not 
prepared to follow their leaders in this feat of elleual amnesia. 

Israel's other tential claim to legitimacy, ernational recognition, is just as dubious. The two 
pas which sealed Palestine's future were both concluded by Britain. First we signed the Sykes-Picot 
agreement with France, edging to divvy up Ottoman sils in the Levant. A year later, in , the 
Balfour Declaration promised a national home for the Jewish people. Under ernational law the

declaration was null and void since Palestine did not belong to Britain - under the pa of the League of 
Nations it belonged to Turkey. 

By the time the UN accepted a resolution on the partition of Palestine in ; Jews constituted 
% of the pulation and owned .% of the land. By , largely as a result of paramilitary 
organizations such as the Haganah, Irgun and Stern gang, Israel controlled % of Palestine and , 
non-Jews had been expelled from their country. 

This then is the tted history of the iniquities surrounding its own birth that Israel must 
acknowledge in order for peace to have a chance. After years of war, peace comes from forgiving, not 
forgetting; people never forget but they have an extraordinary capacity to forgive. 

Far from being a force for liberation and safety after decades of suffering, the idea that Zionist 
Israel is some kind of religious birthright has only imprisoned Jews in a never-ending cycle of confli. 
The "promise" breeds an arrogance which institutionalizes the inferiority of other peoples and generates 
atrocities against them with alarming regularity. It allows soldiers to defy their consciences and blast 
unarmed schoolchildren. It gives rise to legislation seeking to prevent the acquisition of tetory by non- 
Jews. 

More crucially, the promise limits Israel's capacity to seek models of coexistence based on 
equality and the respe of human rights. A state based on so exclusivist a claim to legitimacy cannot but 
conceive of separation as a solution. But separation is not the same as lasting peace; it only pulls apart 
wang parties. It does not heal old wounds, let alone redress historical wrongs. 

However, take away the biblical right and suddenly mutual coexistence, even a one-state solution, 
doesn't seem that far-fetched. What name that coexistence will take is less imrtant than the fa that 
peoples have forgiven and that some measure of justice has been restored. Jews will continue to live in 
the Holy Land - as per the promise - as equals alongside its other rightful inhabitants. 

If that kind of self-reproach is forthcoming, Israel can expe the Palestinians to be forgiving and 
magnanimous in return. The alternative is perpetual war. Faisal Bodi is a Muslim journalist.
