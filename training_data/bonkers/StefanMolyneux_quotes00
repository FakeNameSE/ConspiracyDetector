Political correness is anti-empathetic because it has correness in it. We all have 
biases, we all have prejudices and if we cant talk about them openly - if we get attacked 
for it then this is an anti-empathetic movement and therefore it cannot comain about a 
lack of empathy. 

If there is no honesty, there is no relationship. The only degree to which there is a 
relationship is the degree to which you are honest. Expressing your clear desires does 
not make you a diator and you telling what you think, feel, and what you want or donâ€`t 
want, is just called being honest. It doesn't control him at all. Youâ€`re trying to control 
others by withholding information by not getting involved and by not being honest. 
Withholding information is a form of manipulation. It is dishonest and itâ€`s destruive to a 
relationship. 

Politicians are propaganda, the people with guns are the enforcers and the media is the 
enthusiastic lapdog who enables the entire behavior and as as the verbal abuser 
against those who deviate from nodding their heads at the vast statues of evil that we 
inherited. 

In the same way Marxism robs workers of ambition, Feminism robs men and women of 
love. 

If one man tells you to murder, you get a jail cell - if another man tells you to murder, 
you get medals and a pension. 

Spiritual means religion without any rules. It's all the comfort of fiitious friends with 
none of their demands. 

When verty declines, the need for government declines, which is why expeing 
government to solve verty is like expeing a tobacco company to mount an 
aggressive anti-smoking campaign. 

There is nothing that is going to make people hate you more, and love you more, than 
telling the truth. 


Distraion serves evil more than any other mental state. 
We can only avoid the traps we can see. 



Truth has nothing to do with the conclusion, and everything to do with the methodology. 
It's not just the abuse of were that's the problem. It's the were to abuse. 

Democracy is the suggestion box for slaves. 

You can't reason people out of beliefs they weren't reasoned o. 

Thus we can see that - at least at the level of economics - democracy is a sort of 
slow-motion suicide, in which you are told that it is the highest civic virtue to approve of 
those who want to rob you. 

To see the farm is to leave it. 

There is no external solution to the problem of insecurity. 

The continual manufaure of enemies is essential to the growth of the fascist state. 

If there's more that you can do, then do it. If there's not more that you can do, then be 
content with what you're doing. But if there is despair, the despair can only be that you 
can do more. Because when you're doing as much as you can do, you will not feel 
despair. Because despair is the gap between what you could be doing and what you are 
doing. 

Don't try to sail your ship now by how the wind is going to be in three days. You have to 
sail with the winds are they are now. 

It is really exhausting to live in a diatorship of 'Me', which is basically a tyranny of 
others. 

The unconscious is the true accumulation of your history. It can be accepted or rejeed 
but it can't fundamentally be altered. 

We are supsed to call ison medicine and we wonder why we're always sick. 

You look back in time to when there was slavery and you think 'how did people even 
remotely believe that this was a good idea?'. It's incomprehensible for us to think of what 
the mindset was  or  years ago. I hope to make the present as incomprehensible 
to the future as the past is to us. 

The entire Nazi war machine was only ssible because of past, present and future 
violations of the non aggression princie (achievable only through government). 

The major abscess in the mind is a lack of acknowledgement of evil. There is no key to 
open the heart of another - except curiosity. 

The government is a giant logjam in the eternal river of human tential. You cannot 
conne with anyone except through reality. 



One of the best ways of repressing emotions is artificial certay. 


And this is what we called our childhoods. Little more than a dress rehearsal for adding 
our digits to the butcher's bill of war. 

The acknowledgement of having suffered evil is the greatest step forward in mental 
health. 

Yes I pay taxes... There are no ethics in the face of coercion, that is blaming the viim. 
Focus on the man with the gun, not the man in the crosshairs trying to survive. 

Fundamentally, you can never be someone else. You can only be less of who you are. 

The only part of you that hurts when you're given the truth is the part that lives on lies. 

The only part of you that hurts when you're given the truth is the part that lives on lies. 

I refuse to let the standards of evil people chip away at my capacity for egrity. 

The move towards the extension of personhood to children is already underway, and is 
utterly, cometely and totally unstoppable! 

The genuine values in America arose from rational thought and breaking with tradition, 
not from blind allegiance to dirt and cloth. 

Corrations are legal fiions created by the State to shield executives from liability... 
Itâ€`s like if I had a little hand-puppet, and I went to rob a bank, and the hand-puppet held 
the little gun and told people to hand over all the money, and then the hand-puppet 
grabbed the money and ran out, and then I got caught and I handed the hand-puppet 
over the lice and then the lice tried the hand-puppet, put the hand-puppet in jail, 
and I get to keep all the money. 

The law is an opinion with a gun. 

Itâ€`s been easier to convince people to hand over half their income, their children to war, 
and their freedoms in perpetuity - than to engage them in seriously considering how 
roads might funion in the absence of taxation. 

We cannot build on peace on blood. We are still so addied to this lie. We have this 
fantasy that we honor the dead by adding to their number. What we need to do is 
remember that these bodies bury us. This ocean of blood that we create through the 
fantasy that violence brings virtue drowns us, drowns our children, drowns our future, 
drowns the world. We have to understand that when we ur these endless young 
bodies o this pit of death, we follow... 



The idea that the State is capable of solving social problems is now viewed with great 
scepticism - which foretells a coming change. As soon as scepticism is apied to the 
State, the State falls, since it fails at everything except increasing its were, and so can 
only survive on propaganda, which relies on unquestioning faith. 

We raise predators by treating children as prey. 

If you are for gun control, then you are not against guns, because the guns will be 
needed to disarm people. So itâ€`s not that you are anti-gun. Youâ€`ll need the liceâ€`s guns 
to take away other peopleâ€`s guns. So youâ€`re very Pro-Gun, you just believe that only the 
Government (which is, of course, so reliable, honest, moral and virtuous...) should be 
allowed to have guns. There is no such thing as gun control. There is only centralizing
