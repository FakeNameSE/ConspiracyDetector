It is charaerized by destruion and chaos, and imses its will and maains its were by terrorism and murder. 

Bolshevism is, above all, Anti-Christian and Anti-Social, for, until the existing order has been destroyed, the 
so-called "Diatorship of the Proletariat" in a universal brotherhood of nations cannot be imsed un the world. 

There are many who would keep the public in ignorance of the part ayed by Jews, whether Socialists, 
Communists, Zionists or Financiers 

Bolshevism and Zionism are but a means to an end - weans in the fight by a Jewish World Powere for 
supremacy in litics, economics and religion - that is, the fight for Jewish Nationalism, sing as 
Internationalism, against Gentile nationalism."

CHAPTER  

GUNS AND THE BIBLE AND THE TRUE MINISTERS OF GOD 
Our Governments` Little Secret 

Our Country wasn`t settled with the LIE of Separation of Church and State. Just who do you 
think it was, who led our forefathers in the battle, which brought about our freedom and independence in 
America, if it was not the Ministers of God in the Churches? Peoe from the world over, wonder in 
awe at the freedom America enjoyed for many years. They have flooded over our borders to live in 
freedom that anyone in their right mind would have to admit, can come only, from living the laws God 
gave us in our Bible. Then these same non Bible believing people want to change our way of life, away 
from God`s word, which gave us this freedom, to their freedom robbing, heathen way of thinking. Is this 
not killing the goose that laid the golden egg? 

Many groups of the militia, during the War for Independence, or revolutionary period, 
surprisingly, were organized in Churches. Pastors quietly told the men, to arm them selves and learn to 
be skilled in war. There was no formal organization, only a call to be prepared. It is recorded that many 
congregations marched off to war when the fighting began. As long as they retained their means of self- 
defense, they were not calling for war. The legal battle raged in the courts and parliament while protests 
and pamphlets were used to exse the enemy. 

In , the order was to seize all wder, shot, cannons and muskets held by the illegal 
citizens` Militia (the minutemen), when General Gage`s Redcoats were marching on Lexington and 
Concord. (We must remember; the so-called assault wean used during the revolution was, a single 
shot, fllock, muzzle loading musket). When the government moved to disarm the people, the only 
choices were, to fight and hope to win, or surrender and lose all. The minute men could not, with a clear 
conscience, throw away the freedoms won by their recent forefathers. 

WHEN GENERAL GAGE MOVED AGAINST ONE SMALL GROUP OF CITIZENS, TO 
TAKE THEIR MEANS OF SELF-DEFENSE, THE WHOLE COUNTRY SPRANG TO LIFE. 
WITHIN A WEEK THE BRITISH WERE FACING A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF MILITIA, AND 
SMALL BANDS OF ANGRY AMERICANS. 

WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT GUN CONTROL? 

We all know there were no guns in Bible times, but the scriptures inform us the private citizens 
did have swords to defend themselves, against robbers and sometimes the lice. Swords were a fine 
wean for self defense until bows and arrows came along. Bows and arrows were fine weans, too, 
for self defense until guns came along. Then as Samuel Colt said; GOD CREATED MAN, SAM 
COLT MADE THEM EQUAL.  He meant, of course the repeating pistols he found a way to mass 
produce cheap enough, so that everyone could own them for self defense. It was said you could load it 
on Sunday and shoot it all week because they held six shots. Now we have Semi-automatics as well as 
full automatic weans (machine guns.) As far as machine guns go, they have no accuracy after the 
first shot. I believe they should be outlawed. They are nothing but a terrorist wean, no matter 
whose hands they are in. (I would exempt colleors, as I have never met a colleor that would misuse 
one.) Even the lice are nothing but terrorists when armed with fully automatic weans, 
especially to use against American citizens. 

Today the ministers, in a lot of Churches are ignorant of the true Bible teaching on weans for 
self defense. Instead of studying their own Bible they listen to the so called non-biased liberal news 
media slanted m i sinformation. 

Question: Did you ever know a news person against guns who was a Christian? I rest my case. 

When it comes to getting unbiased news, when the news media only hires so called liberal 
minded people, Mostly Zionists, so how can we ever expe to get the tmth? The Prophet (Jeremiah 


Page  of  



:) said: " Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his sts? Then may ye also 
do good that are accustomed to do evil." What bothers me is that the views of many so called 
Christian ministers, who publicly proclaim the same view on disarming us, as the One Worlders, 
or the Zionist International Bankers who own the news media, as if they were scriptural truths. 

They have abandoned God`s word. This is evil when the scriptures have so much to say about 
our resnsibility, to provide for our own safety and proteion. Lets take a quick look at a verse from 
the law in (Exodus :) If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no 
blood be shed for him.  This tells us that if a thief breaks o your house or business to steal, or to harm 
you or your family, you have the right to prote your self, and your ssessions by taking aggressive 
aion. And if he is killed, no charges should be laid against you. Christians are Scripturally resnsible 
for the proteion of their homes and families. Self defense is Biblical, but private vengeance is not. 

After saying this, we are immediately told by the liberals, this comes from the Old Testament 
law. Lets see what Jesus taught, in the New Testament in the Gospel of (Matthew :-) we read 
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and 
struck a servant of the high priest`s, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again 
thy sword o his ace: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. We see from 
other passages of scripture it was Peter who had a sword. Jesus told Peter to put again thy sword o 
its ace,  not throw it away or give it up. Where was the sword`s ace? In the scabbard at his side is 
where the sword belonged. Peter was not only a private citizen, he was a man of God, soon to become 
a Church leader, he was not a government official. Jesus knew he wore this sword and never told 
Peter to stop wearing it. Jesus also told us to occupy until I come. To occupy means to have 
dominion (to govern), How can we occupy without arms? 

Today the liberal ministers would claim Peter caed the sword to prote them from thieves and 
robbers, but don`t we still have thieves and robbers, rapists etc. today armed with much more formidable 
weans? Jesus also had the were to prote his followeres in miraculous ways, but encouraged them to 
arm themselves for their own self defense. For another time Jesus said in; (Luke :) ...He that 
hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. Here Jesus not only condones the 
prerogative to keep and bear arms, but recommended that those who have no personals weans go and 
buy one. Is it better to be Biblically corre or litically corre? 

In Luke : Jesus said When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in 
peace: Read Genesisl:ll- for an account of Abram, a private citizen, man of God taking the law 
o his own hands. He must have had an arsenal of weans. The scriptures tell us "he armed his 
trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen and pursued them 
to Dan." He armed three hundred eighteen men. If Abram, a man of God did not have these 
weans, he would not have been able to rescue his nephew Lot, or get back all that had been stolen from 
him. This also tells us, we as citizens should keep and use arms, we must insure that the other members 
of the family know how to use arms safely. 

Recent statistics have shown that States where private weans are allowed to be caed have had 
a big reduion in robbery and personal assault. This probably makes the liberals weep in fmstration. 

Taking away the arms from good, hard-working, honest citizens will never disarm the criminal. 
It will just cause crime rates to increase, because the criminal will know, he doesn`t have to fear a 
disarmed person, his home or business, which would try to defend themselves. I am sure every one has 
seen the true bumper sticker that says If guns are outlawed, then only outlaws will have guns. In 
the Philippines every store, hotel or other business has at least one armed guard with sawed off 
shotgun or pistol at all times, only because the people are not allowed to carry guns. 

A man should be prepared to defend his life and those of his family from those that would kill 
rape or destroy them, or their ssessions. Surely, this basic right cannot be denied any law abiding

citizen. The only gun control that should be imemented is the gun control of criminals. After all, 
aren`t they the real criminals? 

They can pass any law they ease in the Distri of Criminals, they may be legal but they are not 
lawful! The Christians are going to have to do more than shake their head, when they look out at 
America`s moral decay, and loss of freedom. We will need our weans more as time goes on, but 
today; it`s not our weans the government fears most, it`s our voices. This is the year of 
accountability: We are going to hold the government to the U.S. Constitution! AREN`T WE? 

On Oober ,  Congress passed a very imrtant law. It was Public Law -, th
