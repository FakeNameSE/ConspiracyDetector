Quotes 

DOUGLAS WILSON 

“We live in a feminist and effeminate 
culture. Because of this, at best, as a 
people we are uneasy with masculin- 
ity, and with increasing regularity, 
whenever it manages to appear 
somehow, we call for someone to do 
something about it.” 



THOMAS HUGHES 

“In this life-long fight, to be waged by 
every one of us singlehanded against 
a host of foes, the last requisite for 
a good fight, the last proof and test 
of our courage and manfulness, must 
be loyalty to truth  the most rare 
and difficult of all human qualities. 
For such loyalty, as it grows in per- 
feion, asks ever more and more of 
us, and sets before us a standard of 
manliness always rising higher and 
higher.” 


NORMAN MAILER 

“Masculinity is not something given 
to you, but something you gain. And 
you gain it by winning small battles 
with honor.” 




JOHN WAYNE 

“I won’t be wronged, I won’t be 
insulted, and I won’t be laid a hand 
on. I don’t do these things to other 
people, and I require the same from 
them.”
