Technologies and Strategies: There needs to be a concerted effort to produce and 
use energy more efficiently and to emit lower amounts of greenhouse gases, and to 
reduce emissions and increase the uptake of carbon in agricultural, forestry and 
rangeland systems. In addition to energy and land-use technologies, information 
technologies can be used, inter-alia, for the more efficient management of energy 
systems, improve the efficiency of transportation systems and decrease travel miles 
through telecommuting and teleconferencing. 

• Supply side options include: 

• fuel switching (coal to gas) 

• increased power plant efficiency (co-generation) 

• carbon dioxide sequestration (carbon dioxide separation followed by long-term 
sequestration) 

• renewable energies, e.g., wind, solar electric, solar thermal, modern biomass, 
small-scale hydropower and geothermal 

• nuclear 

• Demand-side options include: 

• transportation (e.g., lighter vehicles, increased combustion efficiency, alter- 
nate fuels (e.g., fuel cells), electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles (combustion/elec- 
tric) — land-use planning can improve the efficiency of transportation systems. 

• commercial and residential buildings (e.g., building shells, lighting, heating 
and air conditioning systems, computers, appliances) 

• industry (e.g., processes, recycling) 

• Agriculture, Forestry and Rangelands 

• improved agricultural (e.g., no-till) and grazing land management 

• agroforestry (only a significant option in developing countries) 

• afforestation, reforestation, slowing deforestation and improved forest man- 
agement
