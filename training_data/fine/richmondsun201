Cowardice of the man she loved and
the collapse of ' the "higher romance"
were charged today, by the slayer
against Dr. David Roberts.
A pallid sufferer on a hospital cot,
by her own hand, Miss Lusk today
begged for the death she failed to ac
complish when she , ired two bullets
into her own body after killing Mrs.
Roberts- But she display a degree
of her old time vigorous temper when
she laid bare the sordidness of the
affair that, has linked her and Roberts

ment she claimed support in the let
ter Roberts wrote her.
Roberts Denies Note
Roberts, however, has denied writ
ing anything to Miss Lusk. The un
signed pencilings, said to be in his
band, found among the effects of the
psychology teacher who shot down

"It is spring now," was written in
one of the masculine notes to Miss
Lusk, "and I. feel that I want to walk
with you in green pastures now,
now, now." .
"O, he has the maudlin and common
sentiment that characterizes only the
horse doctor," said the teacher, when
she was reminded of this note. "I
thought his mentality matched mine,
that his conception of ideals was pure
and his intellectuality a rock of ages;
but he is a charlatan. He has sacri
ficed me and his wife on the altar of
common desire."
