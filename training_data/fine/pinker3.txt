Waging peace can be almost as difficult as waging war, and for Colombia, the remaining challenges are considerable. The agreement must be ratified in a plebiscite, and implementing it will require the rebels to surrender their weapons, withdraw from drug trafficking and submit to a procedure of transitional justice. The agreement does not yet embrace a smaller rebel group known as the National Liberation Army, though negotiations are in progress. There must also be investments in rural governance and infrastructure to deal with violence, poverty and corruption.

Post-conflict societies always remain fragile and risk backsliding into war. Only continuing effort, support and vigilance can consolidate and expand the gains that have been made.

Because we have come this far, we know we can go further. Where wars have ended, other forms of bloodshed, such as gang violence, can also be reduced. (In just  years, Colombia, for example, has slashed its notoriously high homicide rate by  percent.) Since the Americas have succeeded in moving away from war, we know this could happen even in the world’s most stubbornly violent regions.

Progress toward peace moves slowly and uncertainly, but it is propelled by determination, ingenuity and the will of millions — and by the realization that peace is not a utopian ideal but an eminently attainable outcome.
