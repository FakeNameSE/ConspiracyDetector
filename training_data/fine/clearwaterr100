Our men cannot get to France or
Belguim in any considerable numbers
for a year. The Government's money
received from the subscriptions to
bonds may get there by wire, the
credit based upon it may, which is
the same thing, and, after getting
there takes the form of clothing and

yacht, which in its turn has destroyed
a submarine.
The American people are not a
money-loving people in the sense that
a miser is. Their money getting
takes more the form of a game, which
is enjoyed because of its skill and the
clash of wits, and their love of the
possession of money is based more
upon the uses to which the money can
be put in elevating their selves and
their children and their neighbors
and the community in which they
live than upon the money itself, or
the reputation of having it.
We are the wealthiest people in the
world; this wealth ought now to
serve the country. It will be a
shameful thing that those who are not
fit for military service should allow
those whfl are fit to go to the front
and be maimed and mangled, and per
haps killed, while they stay at home
and refuse to do even so much as
loosen their purse strings.

The American Soldier.
Goodwin's; 'When Franee, Ger
many, Great Britian, Japan and the
United States sent detachments from
their respective armies to Pekin to
surpress the Boxer uprising, another
British officer said. "For three or
four days the American detachment
was the ridicule of all the others.
They marched in irregular ranks -like
civilians rather than soldiers: they
were careless in their attire and
seemed more like a mob than a de
tachment of trained soldiers.
But one morning early, the Boxers
in heavy force attacked our front,
their immediate assault being directed
against the Americun contingent.
Then we witnessed a transformation.
Those careless men were all in perfect
alignment : their steps changed from
those of men to those of tigers; at
intervals of three or four minutes
they dropped upon one knee, and tak
ing aim, fired their volleys: then up
and on again, and at about the fourth
-or fifth volley they threw down their
arms and precipitately fled; and then
after giving one cheer of triumpn
those men dropped back into their
careless ways as tho nothing had
happened. There was no more dis
co ntTig of the American command
on that march."
