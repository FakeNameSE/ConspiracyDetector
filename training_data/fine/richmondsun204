dent's Call for Volunteers.
To the Young Men of Richmond:
The President of the United
States has issued a call for ,
volunteers to bring the United
States py, up to its iyHl. war;
strength, and these men are want- "
ed immediately.- -The President
further asks that these , vol
unteers be recruited during the
week of June .
It is to be hoped that the call to
service with the colors will be
promptly responded to by the
young men of Richmond, for Rich
mond and Wayne county must play
its full part in this war. Let our
young men show this coming week
that they are true sons of the Re
public. It will be the supreme sac
rifice but this sacrifice must be
made.
(Signed) WILL J. ROBBINS,
Mayor of Richmond.
Sergeant Warner is in charge of the
United States Army recruiting station
in this city, located at Sixth and Main
streets. Applications for enlistment
should be made there.
Able bodied young men who recently
were listed for conscription will be
called to the colors by September .
The men who volunteer next week In
response to the President's call for
, volunteers will have a advan
tage of two months training before
the draft is resorted to and many of
these volunteers will be appointed non
commissioned officers for the con
script army.
Uncle Sam needs fighting men. He
needs YOU. Remember the United
States is now engaged in the greatest
war of its history and its outcome de
pends entirely upon the way the young
men of the Republic respond to the
call to service.
Next week notices containing the
President's proclamation calling for
volunteers will be displayed through
out the city, the cost of printing these
notices being defrayed out of the pa
triotic fund raised In Richmond more

Today Ackerman
the - Kaiser. : Some Americans, and
they are not all hyphenated, especial
ly In the Middle West, believe the
Kaiser is the same as his people.
There seems to be an impression that
we cannot accomplish our purpose in
entering the war; that we cannot make
democracy safe. I found in Indiana
and Illinois people who believed that
Germany could never be defeated.
Some stated our entrance on the side
of the Entente was really to give us a
voice at the peace conference! While
Americans, will admt that the extens
ion of German ruthlessness to the high
seas dragged us unwillingly into the
European maelstrom of shells, poison
and blood, still they do not understand
how by declaring war we can help free
the German people from their Imperial
