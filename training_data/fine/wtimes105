The "great mob scene." which has
characterized the turbulent frays of
tteanesaay and yesterday, was al
most absent this morning. The suf

From what police officials had to
say later, it Is evident the arrest ol

wasn't, needed, though, for Major
Pullman decided to release both cap

couldn't say when the trial would b
ready.
The Police Department. It was be
lieved In official circles, has received
a tip either from the W, "o House or
from District Attorney Laskey to go
ahead with the arrests, which may
mean that the local prosecutor ll

t-uffragtsts are undoubtedly ready ta
wage.
Miss Burns had not been back In
suffrage headquarters ten minutes
after the police action before It was
announced that an attorney had been
retained, though his name was under
cover.
Tie suffrage leaders. Miss Alice
Paul. Mrs. Abby Scott Baker, and tha
rest--couldn't exactly explain why
