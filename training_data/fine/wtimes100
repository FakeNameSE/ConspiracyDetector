Prince Georges Prohibition
Bill May Be Enacted Today.
METZEROTT FOR SUBMISSION
Only One Delegate From County,
Now Opposing Measure.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., June . In
spite of desperate efforts on the part
of the saloon Interests of the State,
which hare been massed to prevent
any spread of prohibition, the Prince
George's dry bill has gained strength
over night, and, with four of the fire
representatives from the county In
the Maryland legislature actively on
Us side, there is every prospect that
It will pass the final reading In the
lloose of delegates tftla afternoon.
and may be acted upon favorably by
the senate before adjournment to
night.
An effort Is being made to finish
business and adjourn finally tonight,
but an adjournment until Monday ap
pears more probable.
The dry cause has been much
strengthened by the fact that Dele
gate Metzerott. the Republican floor
leader. Is now definitely for the bill.
In view of the fact that tha measure
was defeated, though by a narrow
margin, when it was voted upon last
fall, Mr. Metzerott believed It should
be submitted again.
Oppose. Half Dry. Half Wet.
He Is convinced that It would be
Impracticable to takea vote In time
to make Prince George's dry at the
same time the District closes its sa
Joona, and he recognlxeathe strong
feeling In JUInce-Gearg.'s and else
where that conditions will be un
bearable with a dry District and a.
wet Prince George's.

only member from Prince George's
who adheres to the referendum as a
condition.
An effort was made to lay the
whole matter on the table yesterday
aftemoon, and It lost by a vote of S

the bill voted with the majority in
order to give the bil( a fair chance,
and the vote for it is not likely to
show such a disparity, but there I& no
question but what It will have a sub

this afternoon.

There was some talk of hindering
the passage of the bill by including I
Annapolis In It provisions. It looked 
plausible, as Annapolis, the seat of
the Naval Academy, could be made'
dry on many of the grounds which
support the measure for Prince
George's.
However. It would make many new
enemies for the bill and Jeopardize
Its passage The effort was not made
In the house, though It may appear
when the bill reaches the senate.
The support which Senator Hol

body makes its passage almost ccr
