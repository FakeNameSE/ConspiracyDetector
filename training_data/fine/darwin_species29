here more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals
those points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by
continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the
breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference there
is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle of
the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails, etc.,
these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even
in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously
difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently individuals
are born which depart widely from the standard. There may be truly
said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the
tendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate
tendency to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand,
the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the long run
selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed
a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain. But
as long as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected
to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification. It
further deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by
man's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown
to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as
with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.

Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species
of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an
extraordinary amount of modification, since the period when the species
branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This period will
seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure
for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of
modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of
variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural
selection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of
the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and
long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a
general rule, expect still to find more variability in such parts than
in other parts of the organisation, which have remained for a much
longer period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case.
That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the
tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the
course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may
be made constant, I can see no reason to doubt. Hence when an organ,
however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the
same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing
of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory, for an
immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no more
variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which
the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great
that we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,
still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability
will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the
individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the
continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less
modified condition.

The principle included in these remarks may be extended. It is notorious
that specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a
simple example what is meant. If some species in a large genus of plants
had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific
character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species
varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue
flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation
would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because
an explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists
would advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable
than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological
importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe this
explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have
to return to this subject in our chapter on Classification. It would be
almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement,
that specific characters are more variable than generic; but I have
repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author
has remarked with surprise that some IMPORTANT organ or part, which is
generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has DIFFERED
considerably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been VARIABLE
in the individuals of some of the species. And this fact shows that a
character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value
and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its
physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind
applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire seems to
entertain no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in
the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to
individual anomalies.

On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,
why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same
part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be
more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several
species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the
view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might
surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts
of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period,
and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another
manner:--the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each
other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus,
are called generic characters; and these characters in common I
attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely
have happened that natural selection will have modified several species,
fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same
manner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited
from a remote period, since that period when the species first branched
off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or
come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not
probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other hand,
the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus,
are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have
varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the
species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still
often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable than those
parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained
constant.

In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other
remarks. I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details,
that secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also will
be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more
widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of
their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference
between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual
characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between
their females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted. The
cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is
not manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been
rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for
secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection,
which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does
not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured
males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual
characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had
a wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving
to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their
sexual characters, than in other parts of their structure.

It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between
the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very
same parts of the organisation in which the different species of
the same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in
illustration two instances, the first which happen to stand on my list;
and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature,
the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the
tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles,
but in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly;
and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species:
again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is
a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups;
but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species,
and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. This relation has a
clear meaning on my view of the subject: I look at all the species
of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same
progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one of the species.
