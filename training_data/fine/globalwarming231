the needs of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, the current IPCC work 
program has been designed to provide the scientific, technical and economic infor- 
mation that is needed to implement the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. 

The IPCC provides comprehensive assessments of the state of knowledge every 
five years, complemented by technical papers, special reports, and methodological 
work. 

The IPCC is in the midst of the preparation and peer-review of the Third Assess- 
ment Report, including the Synthesis Report, and has, during the last year, com- 
pleted work on four special reports: (i) Aviation and the Global Atmosphere; (ii) 
Methodological and Technological Aspects of Technology Transfer: Opportunities for 
Technology Cooperation; (iii) Emissions Scenarios of Greenhouse Gases and Aerosol 
Precursors; and (iv) Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. The Summaries for 
Policymakers for each of these special reports is included in a series of Annexes * 
to this testimony. The three Working Group Reports of the TAR will be completed 
between January  and March , while the Synthesis Report will be com- 
pleted in September/October . 

The Third Assessment Report will be a comprehensive assessment and build upon 
the findings of the Second assessment Report, which was completed in . The 
Third assessment Report will: (i) emphasize cross-sectoral issues, adaptation and 
the regional dimensions of climate change; (ii) place the issue of climate change 
more centrally within the concept of sustainable development; and (iii) identify the 
synergies and trade-offs between local, regional and global environmental issues, in 
particular the inter-linkages between climate change, biodiversity, water resources 
and land degradation. 

All IPCC assessments are prepared and peer-reviewed, according to an approved 
set of principles and procedures, by experts from all relevant disciplines (natural sci- 
entists, social Scientists, and technologists), from all stakeholder groups (univer- 
sities, government agencies, industry, business and environmental organizations) 
and from all around the world. Over two thousand experts, from over one hundred 
countries, participated in the preparation and peer-review of the Second Assessment 
Report. The reports emphasize what is known and what is uncertain. Areas of con- 
troversy are discussed and alternate viewpoints presented. 

The IPCC is currently structured into three Working Groups: 

Working Group I 

The climate system: Sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols; observed 
changes in atmospheric composition, climate variables, cryosphere, and sea level; cli- 
mate variability; physical and biogeochemical processes; evaluation of approaches 
for developing regional climate information; evaluation of models; model simulations 
of past and current regional and global climate; model simulations of future regional 
and global changes in atmospheric composition, radiative forcing, climate, 
cryosphere, and sea level, using agreed and proposed policies to mitigate climate 
change, different stabilization levels of greenhouse gases, and the emissions sce- 
narios from the ongoing special report; and detection and attribution of climate 
change. 

Working Group II 

Regional, sectoral and cross-sectoral impacts of and adaptation to, climate change, 
including the social dimensions (e.g., equity) ana economic costs and benefits: Prim- 
ers on how terrestrial and marine ecological and hydrological processes respond to 
changes in climatic conditions and atmospheric composition, e.g., increased carbon 
dioxide concentrations; primer on human health mechanisms; methodological ap- 
proaches to the impact of, and adaptation to, climate change, for ecological systems, 
human health and socio-economic sectors; issues in integrating ecological and eco- 
nomic assessments of impacts and adaptation potential; evaluation of the sensitivity 
of ecological systems, human health and socio-economic sectors to climatic variables; 
regional evaluations of the sectoral and cross-sectoral impacts of climate change, in- 
cluding the social dimensions and economic costs and benefits; regional sectoral and 
cross-sectoral adaptation strategies (technological, institutional, and policy aspects) 
in the context of meeting human needs; and global sectoral assessments (e.g., move- 
ments in ecosystem boundaries, and changes in agricultural and fisheries produc- 
tivity at the global level). Impact studies will: (i) use a range of transient GCM pro-

jections of climate change, be placed in the context of other changes in socio-eco- 
nomic and environmental conditions, and assess to what degree climate change af- 
fects the ability to meet human needs (adequate food, clean water, a healthy envi- 
ronment, safe shelter, etc.); and (ii) be performed for a range of climates associated 
with different greenhouse gas stabilization levels. 

Working Group III 

Mitigation of climate change, including the social aspects and economic costs and 
benefits, and methodological aspects of cross-cutting issues: Methodological issues as- 
sociated with mitigation, equity, discount rates, decision-making framework, uncer- 
tainties, and integrated assessment modeling; evaluation of the technical, economic 
and market potential of energy supply and demand and land-use technologies, re- 
gional assessments of the mitigation potential of different technologies, including 
the social dimensions and economic costs and benefits, with and integrated energy- 
related and land-related mitigation options, including “distributional” costs for dif- 
ferent stabilization levels and different emissions profiles; and evaluation of policy 
options (including carbon and energy taxes, subsidy elimination, internalization of 
local and regional environmental externalities, emissions trading and joint imple- 
mentation). 

In addition to the three Working Group Reports, the Third Assessment Report 
will contain a Synthesis Report, which is based on previously approved IPCC re- 
ports and will address the following ten key policy-relevant questions (abbreviated): 

• What can scientific, technical and socio-economic analyses contribute to the de- 
termination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the 
climate system as referred to in Article  of the Framework Convention on Cli- 
mate Change? 

• What is the evidence for, causes of, and consequences of changes in the Earth’s 
climate since the pre-industrial era? 

• What is known about the influence of the increasing atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the projected human-induced change in 
climate regionally and globally? 

• What is known about the inertia and time-scales associated with the changes 
in the climate system, ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors and their 
interactions? 

• What is known about the regional and global climatic, environmental, and 
socio-economic consequences in the next ,  and  years associated with 
a range of greenhouse gas emissions arising from scenarios used in the TAR 
(projections which involve no climate policy interventions)? 

• How does the extent and timing of the introduction of a range of emissions re- 
duction actions determine and affect the rate, magnitude, and impacts of cli- 
mate change, and affect the global and regional economy, taking into account 
the historical and current emissions? 

• What is known from sensitivity studies about the regional and global climatic, 
environmental and socio-economic consequences of stabilizing the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases (in carbon dioxide equivalents), at a range 
of levels from today’s to double that or more, taking into account to the extent 
possible the effects of aerosols. For each stabilization scenario, including dif- 
ferent pathways to stabilization, evaluate the range of costs and benefits, rel- 
ative to the range of scenarios considered in question . 

• What is known about the interactions between projected human-induced 
changes in climate and other environmental issues, e.g., urban air pollution, re- 
gional acid deposition, loss of biological diversity, stratospheric ozone depletion, 
and desertification and land degradation? What is known about the environ- 
mental, social and economic costs and benefits and implications of these inter- 
actions for integrating climate response strategies in an equitable manner into 
broad sustainable development strategies at the local, regional and global lev- 
els?
