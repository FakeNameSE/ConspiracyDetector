THE KID HAS GONE TO THE
COLORS
The Kid has gone to the colors
And we don't know what to say;
The Kid we have loved and cuddled
Stepped out for the Flag today.
We thought him a child, a baby, '
With never a care at alL
But his country called him man size
And the Kid has heard the call.
He paused to watch the recruiting,
Where, fired by the fife and drum,
He bowed his head to Old Glory,
And thought that it whispered
. "Come."
The Kid, not being a slacker.
Stood forth with patriot joy
To add his name to the roster .
And God, we're proud of the boy. v
The Kid has gone to the colors:
It seems but a little while
Since he drilled a schoolboy army
In a truly martial style.
But now he's a man, a soldier.
And we lend him a listening ear,
For his heart is a heart all loyal,
Uu&courged by the curse of fear.
