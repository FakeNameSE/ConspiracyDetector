see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,
commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,
and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary
laws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in each region
where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now
flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where
the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a
general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if
varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger
genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient
species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for
they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the
species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of the larger
genera apparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in
little groups round other species--in which respects they resemble
varieties. These are strange relations on the view of each species
having been independently created, but are intelligible if all species
first existed as varieties.

As each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to
increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each
species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become
more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize
on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there
will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most
divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued
course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of
varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater
differences characteristic of species of the same genus. New and
improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older,
less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered
to a large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species
belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant
forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at
the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus
succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the
more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the large
groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together
with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the
arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups,
all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around us,
and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the
grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the
theory of creation.

As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,
favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification;
it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of "Natura
non facit saltum," which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to
make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We
can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in
innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has
been independently created, no man can explain.

Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How
strange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have
been created to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which
never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a
thrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects;
and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure
fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other
cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in
number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying
descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,
these facts cease to be strange, or perhaps might even have been
anticipated.

As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants
of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their
associates; so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of
any one country, although on the ordinary view supposed to have been
specially created and adapted for that country, being beaten and
supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. Nor ought
we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can
judge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas
of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee's
own death; at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one
single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the
astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred
of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding
within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The
wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of
the want of absolute perfection have not been observed.

The complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as
far as we can see, with the laws which have governed the production of
so-called specific forms. In both cases physical conditions seem to have
produced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone,
they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper
to that zone. In both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have
produced some effect; for it is difficult to resist this conclusion
when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings
incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic
duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally
blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have
their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals
inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. In both varieties and
species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important
part, so that when one part has been modified other parts are
necessarily modified. In both varieties and species reversions to
long-lost characters occur. How inexplicable on the theory of creation
is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the
several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! How simply is
this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from
a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds
of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon!

On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,
why should the specific characters, or those by which the species of
the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic
characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour
of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if
the other species, supposed to have been created independently, have
differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the genus have
the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties,
of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can
understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched
off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which they have
come to be specifically distinct from each other; and therefore these
same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the
generic characters which have been inherited without change for an
enormous period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part
developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus,
and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to the
species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on my view, this
part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common
progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and
therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. But
a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a
bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part
be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited
for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered
constant by long-continued natural selection.

Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater
difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural
selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We
can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing
different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have
attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws
on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt
sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is
not indispensable, as we see, in the case of neuter insects, which leave
no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view
of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common
parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is
that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions
of life, yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of
South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British
species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through
