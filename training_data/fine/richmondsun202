DRY BILL LOOMS"
AS CHIEF ISSUE
WASHINGTON, June . Prohibi
tion as a war measure loomed up as
the big Issue in the house today with
a sharp fight promised before a final
vote on the food control bill, which
was expected by tonight.
The contest was over the question
whether the section of the bill author
izing the president to limit, regulate or
reduce "the supply of food matrials or
feeds used in making alcoholic liquors
shall be changed. 
Prohibitionists were determined to
secure, if possible, the adoption of a
stronger "dry" provision and their
forces were lined up for the fray.
Most of them favor absolute prohi
bition of the use of grain for beverage
purposes during the war but are di
vided over the various pending pro
posals to accomplish this.
Consideration of the food bill con
tinued in the senate today, while the
leaders held further informal confer
ences in an effort to reach an agree
ment on disputed points in the meas
ure. .

CROWN PRINCE'S
ATTACKS FUTILE
(By Associated Press)
Heavy attacks by the Germans are
continuing along the Aisne front with
the fighting at times assuming almost
the proportions of a general engage
ment. No substantial successes have at
tended the Crown Prince's etforts.
The latest bulletins from the front
Indeed indicate to be turning even
more favorably for the French, whose
artillery is proving that it has lost
none of its effectiveness in breaking
up an attack.
The Crown Prince's primary pur
pose apparently is to forestall the re
newal of the French offensive move
ment which was expected in this im
portant sector south and southwest of
the Fortress Loan, the German key
position, which would be seriously
menaced , by a -farther FrewSwidvance.
So far as appears GenerarP?taln has
lost none of his commanding position
while v the Germans have sacrificed
heavily for such small gains as,, they
have. been able to effect.
The plan of the Germans seems to
be, to launch heavy forces on a com
paratively narrow, front in the areas
under attack. They penetrated a sali
ent in the French line yesterday on
the Chemin des Dames in the neigh
borhood of Epin de Chevregny.
Last night they tried to debouch
from the ground gained but found all
their efforts broken up by the French
fire. Other attacks in the region of
Vauixaillon to the west and nearer
Chevreux and other points to the west
were likewise futile.
